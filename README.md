| **[Sound Source Localization for Spatial Mapping of Surgical Actions in Dynamic Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24332v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Surgical scene understanding is key to advancing computer-aided and intelligent surgical systems. Current approaches predominantly rely on visual data or end-to-end learning, which limits fine-grained contextual modeling. This work aims to enhance surgical scene representations by integrating 3D acoustic information, enabling temporally and spatially aware multimodal understanding of surgical environments. Methods: We propose a novel framework for generating 4D audio-visual representations of surgical scenes by projecting acoustic localization information from a phased microphone array onto dynamic point clouds from an RGB-D camera. A transformer-based acoustic event detection module identifies relevant temporal segments containing tool-tissue interactions which are spatially localized in the audio-visual scene representation. The system was experimentally evaluated in a realistic operating room setup during simulated surgical procedures performed by experts. Results: The proposed method successfully localizes surgical acoustic events in 3D space and associates them with visual scene elements. Experimental evaluation demonstrates accurate spatial sound localization and robust fusion of multimodal data, providing a comprehensive, dynamic representation of surgical activity. Conclusion: This work introduces the first approach for spatial sound localization in dynamic surgical scenes, marking a significant advancement toward multimodal surgical scene representations. By integrating acoustic and visual data, the proposed framework enables richer contextual understanding and provides a foundation for future intelligent and autonomous surgical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiFi-HARP: A High-Fidelity 7th-Order Ambisonic Room Impulse Response Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21257v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce HiFi-HARP, a large-scale dataset of 7th-order Higher-Order Ambisonic Room Impulse Responses (HOA-RIRs) consisting of more than 100,000 RIRs generated via a hybrid acoustic simulation in realistic indoor scenes. HiFi-HARP combines geometrically complex, furnished room models from the 3D-FRONT repository with a hybrid simulation pipeline: low-frequency wave-based simulation (finite-difference time-domain) up to 900 Hz is used, while high frequencies above 900 Hz are simulated using a ray-tracing approach. The combined raw RIRs are encoded into the spherical-harmonic domain (AmbiX ACN) for direct auralization. Our dataset extends prior work by providing 7th-order Ambisonic RIRs that combine wave-theoretic accuracy with realistic room content. We detail the generation pipeline (scene and material selection, array design, hybrid simulation, ambisonic encoding) and provide dataset statistics (room volumes, RT60 distributions, absorption properties). A comparison table highlights the novelty of HiFi-HARP relative to existing RIR collections. Finally, we outline potential benchmarks such as FOA-to-HOA upsampling, source localization, and dereverberation. We discuss machine learning use cases (spatial audio rendering, acoustic parameter estimation) and limitations (e.g., simulation approximations, static scenes). Overall, HiFi-HARP offers a rich resource for developing spatial audio and acoustics algorithms in complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[MRSAudio: A Large-Scale Multimodal Recorded Spatial Audio Dataset with Refined Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10396v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans rely on multisensory integration to perceive spatial environments, where auditory cues enable sound source localization in three-dimensional space. Despite the critical role of spatial audio in immersive technologies such as VR/AR, most existing multimodal datasets provide only monaural audio, which limits the development of spatial audio generation and understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce MRSAudio, a large-scale multimodal spatial audio dataset designed to advance research in spatial audio understanding and generation. MRSAudio spans four distinct components: MRSLife, MRSSpeech, MRSMusic, and MRSSing, covering diverse real-world scenarios. The dataset includes synchronized binaural and ambisonic audio, exocentric and egocentric video, motion trajectories, and fine-grained annotations such as transcripts, phoneme boundaries, lyrics, scores, and prompts. To demonstrate the utility and versatility of MRSAudio, we establish five foundational tasks: audio spatialization, and spatial text to speech, spatial singing voice synthesis, spatial music generation and sound event localization and detection. Results show that MRSAudio enables high-quality spatial modeling and supports a broad range of spatial audio research. Demos and dataset access are available at https://mrsaudio.github.io.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[Multi Agent Switching Mode Controller for Sound Source localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14849v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source seeking is an important topic in robotic research, especially considering sound-based sensors since they allow the agents to locate a target even in critical conditions where it is not possible to establish a direct line of sight. In this work, we design a multi- agent switching mode control strategy for acoustic-based target localization. Two scenarios are considered: single source localization, in which the agents are driven maintaining a rigid formation towards the target, and multi-source scenario, in which each agent searches for the targets independently from the others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observer-Based Source Localization in Tree Infection Networks via Laplace Transforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09828v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of localizing the source of infection in an undirected, tree-structured network under a susceptible-infected outbreak model. The infection propagates with independent random time increments (i.e., edge-delays) between neighboring nodes, while only the infection times of a subset of nodes can be observed. We show that a reduced set of observers may be sufficient, in the statistical sense, to localize the source and characterize its identifiability via the joint Laplace transform of the observers' infection times. Using the explicit form of these transforms in terms of the edge-delay probability distributions, we propose scale-invariant least-squares estimators of the source. We evaluate their performance on synthetic trees and on a river network, demonstrating accurate localization under diverse edge-delay models. To conclude, we highlight overlooked technical challenges for observer-based source localization on networks with cycles, where standard spanning-tree reductions may be ill-posed.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Direction Estimation of Sound Sources Using Microphone Arrays and Signal Strength](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03466v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound-tracking refers to the process of determining the direction from which a sound originates, making it a fundamental component of sound source localization. This capability is essential in a variety of applications, including security systems, acoustic monitoring, and speaker tracking, where accurately identifying the direction of a sound source enables real-time responses, efficient resource allocation, and improved situational awareness. While sound-tracking is closely related to localization, it specifically focuses on identifying the direction of the sound source rather than estimating its exact position in space. Despite its utility, sound-tracking systems face several challenges, such as maintaining directional accuracy and precision, along with the need for sophisticated hardware configurations and complex signal processing algorithms. This paper presents a sound-tracking method using three electret microphones. We estimate the direction of a sound source using a lightweight method that analyzes signals from three strategically placed microphones. By comparing the average power of the received signals, the system infers the most probable direction of the sound. The results indicate that the power level from each microphone effectively determines the sound source direction. Our system employs a straightforward and cost-effective hardware design, ensuring simplicity and affordability in implementation. It achieves a localization error of less than 6 degrees and a precision of 98%. Additionally, its effortless integration with various systems makes it versatile and adaptable. Consequently, this technique presents a robust and reliable solution for sound-tracking and localization, with potential applications spanning diverse domains such as security systems, smart homes, and acoustic monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 32nd International Conference on Systems Engineering (ICSEng'2025)</p></details> |
| **[Estimating Brain Activity with High Spatial and Temporal Resolution using a Naturalistic MEG-fMRI Encoding Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09415v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques trade off between spatial resolution and temporal resolution. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wireless Datasets for Aerial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08752v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into 5G-Advanced and future 6G networks presents a transformative opportunity for wireless connectivity, enabling agile deployment and improved LoS communications. However, the effective design and optimization of these aerial networks depend critically on high-quality, empirical data. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of publicly available wireless datasets collected from an airborne platform called Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform on Advanced Wireless (AERPAW). We highlight the unique challenges associated with generating reproducible aerial wireless datasets, and review the existing related works in the literature. Subsequently, for each dataset considered, we explain the hardware and software used, present the dataset format, provide representative results, and discuss how these datasets can be used to conduct additional research. The specific aerial wireless datasets presented include raw I/Q samples from a cellular network over different UAV trajectories, spectrum measurements at different altitudes, flying 4G base station (BS), a 5G-NSA Ericsson network, a LoRaWAN network, an radio frequency (RF) sensor network for source localization, wireless propagation data for various scenarios, and comparison of ray tracing and real-world propagation scenarios. References to all datasets and post-processing scripts are provided to enable full reproducibility of the results. Ultimately, we aim to guide the community toward effective dataset utilization for validating propagation models, developing machine learning algorithms, and advancing the next generation of aerial wireless systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Autoencoder Priors for Bayesian Inversion: Learn First Observe Later](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19929v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering applications. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated and variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of the specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries. The method provides a flexible geometry-aware train-once-use-anywhere foundation model which is independent of any particular observation process.</p></details> |  |

| **[Is It Certainly a Deepfake? Reliability Analysis in Detection & Generation Ecosystem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17550v3)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As generative models are advancing in quality and quantity for creating synthetic content, deepfakes begin to cause online mistrust. Deepfake detectors are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors, systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region- and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns correlated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical insights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes uncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy synthetic media detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the ICCV 2025 workshop - STREAM</p></details> |
| **[Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15315v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data, illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification. Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polarization based direction of arrival estimation using a radio interferometric array](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15116v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality images of the sky. Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper, we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the detected RFI.</p></details> |  |
| **[StarEmbed: Benchmarking Time Series Foundation Models on Astronomical Observations of Variable Stars](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06200v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benchmark for rigorous and standardized evaluation of state-of-the-art TSFMs on stellar time series observations (``light curves''). We benchmark on three scientifically-motivated downstream tasks: unsupervised clustering, supervised classification, and out-of-distribution source detection. StarEmbed integrates a catalog of expert-vetted labels with multi-variate light curves from the Zwicky Transient Facility, yielding ~40k hand-labeled light curves spread across seven astrophysical classes. We evaluate the zero-shot representation capabilities of three TSFMs (MOIRAI, Chronos, Chronos-Bolt) and a domain-specific transformer (Astromer) against handcrafted feature extraction, the long-standing baseline in the astrophysics literature. Our results demonstrate that these TSFMs, especially the Chronos models, which are trained on data completely unlike the astronomical observations, can outperform established astrophysics-specific baselines in some tasks and effectively generalize to entirely new data. In particular, TSFMs deliver state-of-the-art performance on our out-of-distribution source detection benchmark. With the first benchmark of TSFMs on astronomical time series data, we test the limits of their generalization and motivate a paradigm shift in time-domain astronomy from using task-specific, fully supervised pipelines toward adopting generic foundation model representations for the analysis of peta-scale datasets from forthcoming observatories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Indirect Prompt Injection Attacks Be Detected and Removed?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16580v5)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt injection attacks manipulate large language models (LLMs) by misleading them to deviate from the original input instructions and execute maliciously injected instructions, because of their instruction-following capabilities and inability to distinguish between the original input instructions and maliciously injected instructions. To defend against such attacks, recent studies have developed various detection mechanisms. If we restrict ourselves specifically to works which perform detection rather than direct defense, most of them focus on direct prompt injection attacks, while there are few works for the indirect scenario, where injected instructions are indirectly from external tools, such as a search engine. Moreover, current works mainly investigate injection detection methods and pay less attention to the post-processing method that aims to mitigate the injection after detection. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of detecting and removing indirect prompt injection attacks, and we construct a benchmark dataset for evaluation. For detection, we assess the performance of existing LLMs and open-source detection models, and we further train detection models using our crafted training datasets. For removal, we evaluate two intuitive methods: (1) the segmentation removal method, which segments the injected document and removes parts containing injected instructions, and (2) the extraction removal method, which trains an extraction model to identify and remove injected instructions.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |
| **[Optimal Stopping for Sequential Bayesian Experimental Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21734v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In sequential Bayesian experimental design, the number of experiments is usually fixed in advance. In practice, however, campaigns may terminate early, raising the fundamental question: when should one stop? Threshold-based rules are simple to implement but inherently myopic, as they trigger termination based on a fixed criterion while ignoring the expected future information gain that additional experiments might provide. We develop a principled Bayesian framework for optimal stopping in sequential experimental design, formulated as a Markov decision process where stopping and design policies are jointly optimized. We prove that the optimal rule is to stop precisely when the immediate terminal reward outweighs the expected continuation value. To learn such policies, we introduce a policy gradient method, but show that na\"ive joint optimization suffers from circular dependencies that destabilize training. We resolve this with a curriculum learning strategy that gradually transitions from forced continuation to adaptive stopping. Numerical studies on a linear-Gaussian benchmark and a contaminant source detection problem demonstrate that curriculum learning achieves stable convergence and outperforms vanilla methods, particularly in settings with strong sequential dependencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parking Space Ground Truth Test Automation by Artificial Intelligence Using Convolutional Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13366v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research is part of a study of a real-time, cloud-based on-street parking service using crowd-sourced in-vehicle fleet data. The service provides real-time information about available parking spots by classifying crowd-sourced detections observed via ultrasonic sensors. The goal of this research is to optimize the current parking service quality by analyzing the automation of the existing test process for ground truth tests. Therefore, methods from the field of machine learning, especially image pattern recognition, are applied to enrich the database and substitute human engineering work in major areas of the analysis process. After an introduction into the related areas of machine learning, this paper explains the methods and implementations made to achieve a high level of automation, applying convolutional neural networks. Finally, predefined metrics present the performance level achieved, showing a time reduction of human resources up to 99.58 %. The overall improvements are discussed, summarized, and followed by an outlook for future development and potential application of the analysis automation tool.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images with Spatially Varying Backgrounds and Point Spread Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00156v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a type of amortized variational inference, is a computationally efficient means of constructing probabilistic catalogs of light sources from astronomical images. To date, NPE has not been used to perform inference in models with spatially varying covariates. However, ground-based astronomical images have spatially varying sky backgrounds and point spread functions (PSFs), and accounting for this variation is essential for constructing accurate catalogs of imaged light sources. In this work, we introduce a method of performing NPE with spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs. In this method, we generate synthetic catalogs and semi-synthetic images for these catalogs using randomly sampled PSF and background estimates from existing surveys. Using this data, we train a neural network, which takes an astronomical image and representations of its background and PSF as input, to output a probabilistic catalog. Our experiments with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data demonstrate the effectiveness of NPE in the presence of spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs for light source detection, star/galaxy separation, and flux measurement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Astronomical Journal</p></details> |
| **[Two-Stage Framework for Efficient UAV-Based Wildfire Video Analysis with Adaptive Compression and Fire Source Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16739v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become increasingly important in disaster emergency response by enabling real-time aerial video analysis. Due to the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage 1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1 method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage 1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage 2 compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Algorithms for SD help us combat diseases, misinformation, pollution, and more, and have been studied by physicians, physicists, sociologists, and computer scientists. The field has received considerable attention and been analyzed in many settings (e.g., under different models of spreading processes), yet all previous work shares the same assumption that the network the spreading process takes place in has the same structure at every point in time. For example, if we consider how a disease spreads through a population, it is unrealistic to assume that two people can either never or at every time infect each other, rather such an infection is possible precisely when they meet. Therefore, we propose an extended model of SD based on temporal graphs, where each link between two nodes is only present at some time step. Temporal graphs have become a standard model of time-varying graphs, and, recently, researchers have begun to study infection problems (such as influence maximization) on temporal graphs (arXiv:2303.11703, [Gayraud et al., 2015]). We give the first formalization of SD on temporal graphs. For this, we employ the standard SIR model of spreading processes ([Hethcote, 1989]). We give both lower bounds and algorithms for the SD problem in a number of different settings, such as with consistent or dynamic source behavior and on general graphs as well as on trees.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is based on the first author's master thesis, which is available at arXiv:2503.13567</p></details> |
| **[BleedOrigin: Dynamic Bleeding Source Localization in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection via Dual-Stage Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15094v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with 39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6 challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Enforcing Speech Content Privacy in Environmental Sound Recordings using Segment-wise Waveform Reversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08412v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental sound recordings often contain intelligible speech, raising privacy concerns that limit analysis, sharing and reuse of data. In this paper, we introduce a method that renders speech unintelligible while preserving both the integrity of the acoustic scene, and the overall audio quality. Our approach involves reversing waveform segments to distort speech content. This process is enhanced through a voice activity detection and speech separation pipeline, which allows for more precise targeting of speech. In order to demonstrate the effectivness of the proposed approach, we consider a three-part evaluation protocol that assesses: 1) speech intelligibility using Word Error Rate (WER), 2) sound sources detectability using Sound source Classification Accuracy-Drop (SCAD) from a widely used pre-trained model, and 3) audio quality using the Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD), computed with our reference dataset that contains unaltered speech. Experiments on this simulated evaluation dataset, which consists of linear mixtures of speech and environmental sound scenes, show that our method achieves satisfactory speech intelligibility reduction (97.9% WER), minimal degradation of the sound sources detectability (2.7% SCAD), and high perceptual quality (FAD of 1.40). An ablation study further highlights the contribution of each component of the pipeline. We also show that incorporating random splicing to our speech content privacy enforcement method can enhance the algorithm's robustness to attempt to recover the clean speech, at a slight cost of audio quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing overlapping communities in multiple-source detection: An edge clustering approach for complex networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08265v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The source detection problem in network analysis involves identifying the origins of diffusion processes, such as disease outbreaks or misinformation propagation. Traditional methods often focus on single sources, whereas real-world scenarios frequently involve multiple sources, complicating detection efforts. This study addresses the multiple-source detection (MSD) problem by integrating edge clustering algorithms into the community-based label propagation framework, effectively handling mixed-membership issues where nodes belong to multiple communities. The proposed approach applies the automated latent space edge clustering model to a network, partitioning infected networks into edge-based clusters to identify multiple sources. Simulation studies on ADD HEALTH social network datasets demonstrate that this method achieves superior accuracy, as measured by the F1-Measure, compared to state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. The results highlight the robustness of edge clustering in accurately detecting sources, particularly in networks with complex and overlapping source regions. This work advances the applicability of clustering-based methods to MSD problems, offering improved accuracy and adaptability for real-world network analyses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source Detection in Hypergraph Epidemic Dynamics using a Higher-Order Dynamic Message Passing Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02523v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source detection is crucial for capturing the dynamics of real-world infectious diseases and informing effective containment strategies. Most existing approaches to source detection focus on conventional pairwise networks, whereas recent efforts on both mathematical modeling and analysis of contact data suggest that higher-order (e.g., group) interactions among individuals may both account for a large fraction of infection events and change our understanding of how epidemic spreading proceeds in empirical populations. In the present study, we propose a message-passing algorithm, called the HDMPN, for source detection for a stochastic susceptible-infectious dynamics on hypergraphs. By modulating the likelihood maximization method by the fraction of infectious neighbors, HDMPN aims to capture the influence of higher-order structures and do better than the conventional likelihood maximization. We numerically show that, in most cases, HDMPN outperforms benchmarks including the likelihood maximization method without modification.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in machine learning-based methods, many fail to capture intrinsic dynamics of rumor propagation. In this work, we present SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in Sequential Hypergraphs, which harnesses the recent success of the state space model Mamba, known for its superior global modeling capabilities and computational efficiency, to address this challenge. Specifically, we first employ hypergraphs to model high-order interactions within social networks. Subsequently, temporal network snapshots generated during the propagation process are sequentially fed in reverse order into Mamba to infer underlying propagation dynamics. Finally, to empower the sequential model to effectively capture propagation patterns while integrating structural information, we propose a novel graph-aware state update mechanism, wherein the state of each node is propagated and refined by both temporal dependencies and topological context. Extensive evaluations on eight datasets demonstrate that SourceDetMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI25 |
| **[HyperDet: Source Detection in Hypergraphs via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12894v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hypergraphs offer superior modeling capabilities for social networks, particularly in capturing group phenomena that extend beyond pairwise interactions in rumor propagation. Existing approaches in rumor source detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study, we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion. Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach, showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI25 |
| **[Replay Attacks Against Audio Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14862v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show how replay attacks undermine audio deepfake detection: By playing and re-recording deepfake audio through various speakers and microphones, we make spoofed samples appear authentic to the detection model. To study this phenomenon in more detail, we introduce ReplayDF, a dataset of recordings derived from M-AILABS and MLAAD, featuring 109 speaker-microphone combinations across six languages and four TTS models. It includes diverse acoustic conditions, some highly challenging for detection. Our analysis of six open-source detection models across five datasets reveals significant vulnerability, with the top-performing W2V2-AASIST model's Equal Error Rate (EER) surging from 4.7% to 18.2%. Even with adaptive Room Impulse Response (RIR) retraining, performance remains compromised with an 11.0% EER. We release ReplayDF for non-commercial research use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced RMT estimator for signal number estimation in the presence of colored noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12942v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The subspace-based techniques are widely utilized in various scientific fields, and they need accurate estimation of the signal subspace dimension. The classic RMT estimator for model order estimation based on random matrix theory assumes that the noise is white Gaussian, and performs poorly in the presence of colored noise with unknown covariance matrix. In the presence of colored noise, the multivariate regression (MV-R) algorithm models the source detection as a multivariate regression problem and infers the model order from the covariance matrix of the residual error. However, the MV-R algorithm requires that the noise is sufficiently weaker than the signal. In order to deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel signal number estimation algorithm in the presence of colored noise based on the analysis of the behavior of information theoretic criteria. Firstly, a first criterion is defined as the ratio of the current eigenvalue and the mean of the next ones, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Moreover, a second criterion is designed as the ratio of the current value and the next value of the first criterion, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Then, a novel enhanced RMT estimator is proposed for signal number estimation by analyzing the detection properties among the signal number estimates obtained by these two criteria, the MV-R estimator and the RMT estimator to sequentially determine whether the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a signal or from noise. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate that the proposed enhanced RMT estimator has better estimation performance than the existing methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

While existing research addresses transfer learning under various distribution shifts in independent settings, handling dependencies in networked data remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a high-dimensional transfer learning framework based on network convolutional regression (NCR), inspired by the success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The NCR model incorporates random network structure by allowing each node's response to depend on its features and the aggregated features of its neighbors, capturing local dependencies effectively. Our methodology includes a two-step transfer learning algorithm that addresses domain shift between source and target networks, along with a source detection mechanism to identify informative domains. Theoretically, we analyze the lasso estimator in the context of a random graph based on the Erdos-Renyi model assumption, demonstrating that transfer learning improves convergence rates when informative sources are present. Empirical evaluations, including simulations and a real-world application using Sina Weibo data, demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, particularly when labeled data in the target domain is limited.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhishLang: A Real-Time, Fully Client-Side Phishing Detection Framework Using MobileBERT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05667v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce PhishLang, the first fully client-side anti-phishing framework built on a lightweight ensemble framework that utilizes advanced language models to analyze the contextual features of a website's source code and URL. Unlike traditional heuristic or machine learning approaches that rely on static features and struggle to adapt to evolving threats, or deep learning models that are computationally intensive, our approach utilizes MobileBERT, a fast and memory-efficient variant of the BERT architecture, to capture nuanced features indicative of phishing attacks. To further enhance detection accuracy, PhishLang employs a multi-modal ensemble approach, combining both the URL and Source detection models. This architecture ensures robustness by allowing one model to compensate for scenarios where the other may fail, or if both models provide ambiguous inferences. As a result, PhishLang excels at detecting both regular and evasive phishing threats, including zero-day attacks, outperforming popular anti-phishing tools, while operating without relying on external blocklists and safeguarding user privacy by ensuring that browser history remains entirely local and unshared. We release PhishLang as a Chromium browser extension and also open-source the framework to aid the research community.</p></details> |  |

To address data limitations in studying MSSA sepsis, we extend existing transfer learning frameworks to accommodate transformation models for high-dimensional survival data. Specifically, we construct a measurement index based on C-index for intelligently identifying the helpful source datasets, and the target model performance is improved by leveraging information from the identified source datasets via performing the transfer step and debiasing step. We further provide an algorithm to construct confidence intervals for each coefficient component. Another significant development is that statistical properties are rigorously established, including $\ell_1/\ell_2$-estimation error bounds of the transfer learning algorithm, detection consistency property of the transferable source detection algorithm and asymptotic theories for the confidence interval construction. Extensive simulations and analysis of MIMIC-IV sepsis data demonstrate the estimation and prediction accuracy, and practical advantages of our approach, providing significant improvements in survival estimates for MSSA sepsis patients.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Interaction Matters: Dynamic Hypergraph Neural Networks for Epidemic Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20114v2)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ongoing need for effective epidemic modeling has driven advancements in capturing the complex dynamics of infectious diseases. Traditional models, such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, and graph-based approaches often fail to account for higher-order interactions and the nuanced structure pattern inherent in human contact networks. This study introduces a novel Human Contact-Tracing Hypergraph Neural Network framework tailored for epidemic modeling called EpiDHGNN, leveraging the capabilities of hypergraphs to model intricate, higher-order relationships from both location and individual level. Both real-world and synthetic epidemic data are used to train and evaluate the model. Results demonstrate that EpiDHGNN consistently outperforms baseline models across various epidemic modeling tasks, such as source detection and forecast, by effectively capturing the higher-order interactions and preserving the complex structure of human interactions. This work underscores the potential of representing human contact data as hypergraphs and employing hypergraph-based methods to improve epidemic modeling, providing reliable insights for public health decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Visualizing Privacy-Relevant Data Flows in Android Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16640v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android applications collecting data from users must protect it according to the current legal frameworks. Such data protection has become even more important since in 2018 the European Union rolled out the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since app developers are not legal experts, they find it difficult to integrate privacy-aware practices into source code development. Despite these legal obligations, developers have limited tool support to reason about data protection throughout their app development process. This paper explores the use of static program slicing and software visualization to analyze privacy-relevant data flows in Android apps. We introduce SliceViz, a web tool that analyzes an Android app by slicing all privacy-relevant data sources detected in the source code on the back-end. It then helps developers by visualizing these privacy-relevant program slices. We conducted a user study with 12 participants demonstrating that SliceViz effectively aids developers in identifying privacy-relevant properties in Android apps. Our findings indicate that program slicing can be employed to identify and reason about privacy-relevant data flows in Android applications. With further usability improvements, developers can be better equipped to handle privacy-sensitive information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Discovery and Source Detection in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13567v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers, policy makers, and engineers need to make sense of data on spreading processes as diverse as viral infections, water contamination, and misinformation in social networks. Classical questions include predicting infection behavior in a given network or deducing the structure of a network from infection data. We study two central problems in this area. In graph discovery, we aim to fully reconstruct the structure of a graph from infection data. In source detection, we observe a limited subset of the infections and aim to deduce the source of the infection chain. These questions have received considerable attention and have been analyzed in many settings (e.g., under different models of spreading processes), yet all previous work shares the assumption that the network has the same structure at every point in time. For example, if we consider how a disease spreads, it is unrealistic to assume that two people can either never or always infect each other, rather such an infection is possible precisely when they meet. Temporal graphs, in which connections change over time, have recently been used as a more realistic graph model to study infections. Despite this recent attention, we are the first to study graph discovery or source detection in temporal graphs. We propose models for temporal graph discovery and source detection that are consistent with previous work on static graphs and extend it to embrace the stronger expressiveness of temporal graphs. For this, we employ the standard susceptible-infected-resistant model of spreading processes, which is particularly often used to study diseases. We provide algorithms, lower bounds, and some experimental evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is my Master's thesis submitted at the Digital Engineering Faculty of the University of Potsdam on September 30, 2024.

The algorithm is based on Lagrangian reformulation and innovatively integrates random perturbations and regularizations in primal and dual directions: 1). exponentially distributed random perturbations in the primal direction to handle non-convexity, and 2). strongly concave logarithmic regularizations in the dual space to handle constraint violations. Based on a proposed expected static cumulative regret, and under mild Lipschitz continuity assumption, the algorithm demonstrates the online learnability, achieving the first sublinear cumulative regret complexity for this class of problems. The proposed algorithm is applied to tackle a long-term (extreme value) constrained river pollutant source identification problem, validate the theoretical results and exhibit superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniDFA: A Unified Framework for Open Set Synthesis Image Detection and Few-Shot Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25682v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However, synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates $1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution. Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Physics-informed sensor coverage through structure preserving machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10363v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a machine learning framework for adaptive source localization in which agents use a structure-preserving digital twin of a coupled hydrodynamic-transport system for real-time trajectory planning and data assimilation. The twin is constructed with conditional neural Whitney forms (CNWF), coupling the numerical guarantees of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) with transformer-based operator learning. The resulting model preserves discrete conservation, and adapts in real time to streaming sensor data. It employs a conditional attention mechanism to identify: a reduced Whitney-form basis; reduced integral balance equations; and a source field, each compatible with given sensor measurements. The induced reduced-order environmental model retains the stability and consistency of standard finite-element simulation, yielding a physically realizable, regular mapping from sensor data to the source field. We propose a staggered scheme that alternates between evaluating the digital twin and applying Lloyd's algorithm to guide sensor placement, with analysis providing conditions for monotone improvement of a coverage functional. Using the predicted source field as an importance function within an optimal-recovery scheme, we demonstrate recovery of point sources under continuity assumptions, highlighting the role of regularity as a sufficient condition for localization. Experimental comparisons with physics-agnostic transformer architectures show improved accuracy in complex geometries when physical constraints are enforced, indicating that structure preservation provides an effective inductive bias for source identification.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian thinning algorithm for the point source identification of heat equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14245v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a Bayesian thinning algorithm for recovering weighted point source functions in the heat equation from boundary flux observations. The major challenge in the classical Bayesian framework lies in constructing suitable priors for such highly structured unknowns. To address this, we introduce a level set representation on a discretized mesh for the unknown, which enables the infinite-dimensional Bayesian framework to the reconstruction. From another perspective, the point source configuration can be modeled as a marked Poisson point process (PPP), then a thinning mechanism is employed to selectively retain points. These two proposals are complementary with the Bayesian level set sampling generating candidate point sources and the thinning process acting as a filter to refine them. This combined framework is validated through numerical experiments, which demonstrate its accuracy in reconstructing point sources.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[An Unsupervised Deep XAI Framework for Localization of Concurrent Replay Attacks in Nuclear Reactor Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09162v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition, these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems, additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e., detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1 with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added references, corrected typos, grammar check, authors updated</p></details> |
| **[Set-Valued Transformer Network for High-Emission Mobile Source Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11976v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying high-emission vehicles is a crucial step in regulating urban pollution levels and formulating traffic emission reduction strategies. However, in practical monitoring data, the proportion of high-emission state data is significantly lower compared to normal emission states. This characteristic long-tailed distribution severely impedes the extraction of discriminative features for emission state identification during data mining. Furthermore, the highly nonlinear nature of vehicle emission states and the lack of relevant prior knowledge also pose significant challenges to the construction of identification models.To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Set-Valued Transformer Network (SVTN) to achieve comprehensive learning of discriminative features from high-emission samples, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. Specifically, this model first employs the transformer to measure the temporal similarity of micro-trip condition variations, thus constructing a mapping rule that projects the original high-dimensional emission data into a low-dimensional feature space. Next, a set-valued identification algorithm is used to probabilistically model the relationship between the generated feature vectors and their labels, providing an accurate metric criterion for the classification algorithm. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments on the diesel vehicle monitoring data of Hefei city in 2020. The results demonstrate that our method achieves a 9.5\% reduction in the missed detection rate for high-emission vehicles compared to the transformer-based baseline, highlighting its superior capability in accurately identifying high-emission mobile pollution sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Horizontal and Vertical Federated Causal Structure Learning via Higher-order Cumulants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06888v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated causal discovery aims to uncover the causal relationships between entities while protecting data privacy, which has significant importance and numerous applications in real-world scenarios. Existing federated causal structure learning methods primarily focus on horizontal federated settings. However, in practical situations, different clients may not necessarily contain data on the same variables. In a single client, the incomplete set of variables can easily lead to spurious causal relationships, thereby affecting the information transmitted to other clients. To address this issue, we comprehensively consider causal structure learning methods under both horizontal and vertical federated settings. We provide the identification theories and methods for learning causal structure in the horizontal and vertical federal setting via higher-order cumulants. Specifically, we first aggregate higher-order cumulant information from all participating clients to construct global cumulant estimates. These global estimates are then used for recursive source identification, ultimately yielding a global causal strength matrix. Our approach not only enables the reconstruction of causal graphs but also facilitates the estimation of causal strength coefficients. Our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real-world data.</p></details> |  |

| **[Moments, Time-Inversion and Source Identification for the Heat Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02677v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the initial source identification problem for the heat equation, a notably ill-posed inverse problem characterized by exponential instability. Departing from classical Tikhonov regularization, we propose a novel approach based on moment analysis of the heat flow, transforming the problem into a more stable inverse moment formulation. By evolving the measured terminal time moments backward through their governing ODE system, we recover the moments of the initial distribution. We then reconstruct the source by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of a measure subject to these moment constraints. This formulation naturally promotes sparsity, yielding atomic solutions that are sums of Dirac measures. Compared to existing methods, our moment-based approach reduces exponential error growth to polynomial growth with respect to the terminal time. We provide explicit error estimates on the recovered initial distributions in terms of moment order, terminal time, and measurement errors. In addition, we develop efficient numerical discretization schemes and demonstrate significant stability improvements of our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments.</p></details> | 30 pages |

In this article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly improve processing speed.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we have proposed a novel watermarking technique using perimeter gated SPAD (pgSPAD) imagers. We utilized the DSNU of three 64 x 64 pgSPAD imager chips, fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m standard CMOS process and analyzed the simulated watermarks for standard test images from publicly available database. Our observation shows that both source identification and tamper detection can be achieved using the proposed source-scene-specific dynamic watermarks with a controllable sensitivity-robustness trade-off.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, accepted at MWSCAS 2025 Conference</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability, modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs, and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction at scale.</p></details> |  |

| **[Distributed Multi-robot Source Seeking in Unknown Environments with Unknown Number of Sources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11048v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel distributed source seeking framework, DIAS, designed for multi-robot systems in scenarios where the number of sources is unknown and potentially exceeds the number of robots. Traditional robotic source seeking methods typically focused on directing each robot to a specific strong source and may fall short in comprehensively identifying all potential sources. DIAS addresses this gap by introducing a hybrid controller that identifies the presence of sources and then alternates between exploration for data gathering and exploitation for guiding robots to identified sources. It further enhances search efficiency by dividing the environment into Voronoi cells and approximating source density functions based on Gaussian process regression. Additionally, DIAS can be integrated with existing source seeking algorithms. We compare DIAS with existing algorithms, including DoSS and GMES in simulated gas leakage scenarios where the number of sources outnumbers or is equal to the number of robots. The numerical results show that DIAS outperforms the baseline methods in both the efficiency of source identification by the robots and the accuracy of the estimated environmental density function.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |

While traditional air quality monitoring systems provide critical data, their high costs and limited spatial coverage hinder effective real-time pollutant identification. Recent advancements in micro-sensor technology have improved data collection but still lack efficient methods for source identification. This paper explores the innovative application of machine learning (ML) models to classify pollutants in real-time using only data from optical micro-sensors. We propose a novel classification framework capable of distinguishing between four pollutant scenarios: Background Pollution, Ash, Sand, and Candle. Three Machine Learning (ML) approaches - XGBoost, Long Short-Term Memory networks, and Hidden Markov Chains - are evaluated for their effectiveness in sequence modeling and pollutant identification. Our results demonstrate the potential of leveraging micro-sensors and ML techniques to enhance air quality monitoring, offering actionable insights for urban planning and environmental protection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Detecting such images and identifying their source models has become a critical challenge in ensuring the integrity of digital media. This paper tackles the detection of AI-generated images and identifying their source models using CNN and CLIP-ViT classifiers. For the CNN-based classifier, we leverage EfficientNet-B0 as the backbone and feed with RGB channels, frequency features, and reconstruction errors, while for CLIP-ViT, we adopt a pretrained CLIP image encoder to extract image features and SVM to perform classification. Evaluated on the Defactify 4 dataset, our methods demonstrate strong performance in both tasks, with CLIP-ViT showing superior robustness to image perturbations. Compared to baselines like AEROBLADE and OCC-CLIP, our approach achieves competitive results.

| **[Rapid Parameter Inference with Uncertainty Quantification for a Radiological Plume Source Identification Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17492v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the event of a nuclear accident, or the detonation of a radiological dispersal device, quickly locating the source of the accident or blast is important for emergency response and environmental decontamination. At a specified time after a simulated instantaneous release of an aerosolized radioactive contaminant, measurements are recorded downwind from an array of radiation sensors. Neural networks are employed to infer the source release parameters in an accurate and rapid manner using sensor and mean wind speed data. We consider two neural network constructions that quantify the uncertainty of the predicted values; a categorical classification neural network and a Bayesian neural network. With the categorical classification neural network, we partition the spatial domain and treat each partition as a separate class for which we estimate the probability that it contains the true source location. In a Bayesian neural network, the weights and biases have a distribution rather than a single optimal value. With each evaluation, these distributions are sampled, yielding a different prediction with each evaluation. The trained Bayesian neural network is thus evaluated to construct posterior densities for the release parameters. Results are compared to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) results found using the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis Algorithm. The Bayesian neural network approach is generally much cheaper computationally than the MCMC approach as it relies on the computational cost of the neural network evaluation to generate posterior densities as opposed to the MCMC approach which depends on the computational expense of the transport and radiation detection models.</p></details> |  |

Despite their therapeutic importance, these products can aggregate and form subvisible particles (SvPs), which can compromise their efficacy and trigger immunological responses, emphasizing the critical need for robust monitoring techniques. Flow Imaging Microscopy (FIM) has been a significant advancement in detecting SvPs, evolving from monochrome to more recently incorporating color imaging. Complementing SvP images obtained via FIM, deep learning techniques have recently been employed successfully for stress source identification of monochrome SvPs. In this study, we explore the potential of color FIM to enhance the characterization of stress sources in SvPs. To achieve this, we curate a new dataset comprising 16,000 SvPs from eight commercial monoclonal antibodies subjected to heat and mechanical stress. Using both supervised and self-supervised convolutional neural networks, as well as vision transformers in large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that deep learning with color FIM images consistently outperforms monochrome images, thus highlighting the potential of color FIM in stress source classification compared to its monochrome counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in MICCAI 2024 Workshop on Medical Optical Imaging and Virtual Microscopy Image Analysis (MOVI)</p></details> |
| **[Point Source Identification in Subdiffusion from A Posteriori Internal Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08220v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we investigate an inverse problem of recovering point sources and their time-dependent strengths from {a posteriori} partial internal measurements in a subdiffusion model which involves a Caputo fractional derivative in time and a general second-order elliptic operator in space. We establish the well-posedness of the direct problem in the sense of transposition and improved local regularity. Using classical unique continuation of the subdiffusion model and improved local solution regularity, we prove the uniqueness of simultaneously recovering the locations of point sources, time-dependent strengths and initial condition for both one- and multi-dimensional cases. Moreover, in the one-dimensional case, the elliptic operator can have time-dependent coefficients. These results extend existing studies on point source identification for parabolic type problems. Additionally we present several numerical experiments to show the feasibility of numerical reconstruction.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Humans, however, are inaccurate in localizing sound cues, especially with multiple sources due to limitations in human auditory perception such as angular discrimination error and front-back confusion. This decreases the efficiency of XR interfaces because users misidentify from which XR element a sound is coming. To address this, we propose Auptimize, a novel computational approach for placing XR sound sources, which mitigates such localization errors by utilizing the ventriloquist effect. Auptimize disentangles the sound source locations from the visual elements and relocates the sound sources to optimal positions for unambiguous identification of sound cues, avoiding errors due to inter-source proximity and front-back confusion. Our evaluation shows that Auptimize decreases spatial audio-based source identification errors compared to playing sound cues at the paired visual-sound locations. We demonstrate the applicability of Auptimize for diverse spatial audio-based interactive XR scenarios.</p></details> | UIST 2024 |

However, there is still a lack of neural network-based methods for point source identification, mainly due to the inherent solution singularity. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm to identify point sources, utilizing a neural network combined with a singularity enrichment technique. We employ the fundamental solution and neural networks to represent the singular and regular parts, respectively, and then minimize an empirical loss involving the intensities and locations of the unknown point sources, as well as the parameters of the neural network. Moreover, by combining the conditional stability argument of the inverse problem with the generalization error of the empirical loss, we conduct a rigorous error analysis of the algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with several challenging experiments.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Causal Discovery of Linear Non-Gaussian Causal Models with Unobserved Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04907v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider linear non-Gaussian structural equation models that involve latent confounding. In this setting, the causal structure is identifiable, but, in general, it is not possible to identify the specific causal effects. Instead, a finite number of different causal effects result in the same observational distribution. Most existing algorithms for identifying these causal effects use overcomplete independent component analysis (ICA), which often suffers from convergence to local optima. Furthermore, the number of latent variables must be known a priori. To address these issues, we propose an algorithm that operates recursively rather than using overcomplete ICA. The algorithm first infers a source, estimates the effect of the source and its latent parents on their descendants, and then eliminates their influence from the data. For both source identification and effect size estimation, we use rank conditions on matrices formed from higher-order cumulants. We prove asymptotic correctness under the mild assumption that locally, the number of latent variables never exceeds the number of observed variables. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to overcomplete ICA even though it does not know the number of latents in advance.</p></details> |  |

The resulting ADMM-PINNs algorithmic framework substantially enlarges the applicable range of PINNs to nonsmooth cases of PDE-constrained optimization problems. The application of the ADMM makes it possible to untie the PDE constraints and the nonsmooth regularization terms for iterations. Accordingly, at each iteration, one of the resulting subproblems is a smooth PDE-constrained optimization which can be efficiently solved by PINNs, and the other is a simple nonsmooth optimization problem which usually has a closed-form solution or can be efficiently solved by various standard optimization algorithms or pre-trained neural networks. The ADMM-PINNs algorithmic framework does not require to solve PDEs repeatedly, and it is mesh-free, easy to implement, and scalable to different PDE settings. We validate the efficiency of the ADMM-PINNs algorithmic framework by different prototype applications, including inverse potential problems, source identification in elliptic equations, control constrained optimal control of the Burgers equation, and sparse optimal control of parabolic equations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Identifying the Source of Generation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12846v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) memorize text from several sources of documents. In pretraining, LLM trains to maximize the likelihood of text but neither receives the source of the text nor memorizes the source. Accordingly, LLM can not provide document information on the generated content, and users do not obtain any hint of reliability, which is crucial for factuality or privacy infringement. This work introduces token-level source identification in the decoding step, which maps the token representation to the reference document. We propose a bi-gram source identifier, a multi-layer perceptron with two successive token representations as input for better generalization. We conduct extensive experiments on Wikipedia and PG19 datasets with several LLMs, layer locations, and identifier sizes. The overall results show a possibility of token-level source identifiers for tracing the document, a crucial problem for the safe use of LLMs.</p></details> | ICPRAI 2024 |
| **[A novel shape optimization approach for source identification in elliptic equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02909v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel shape optimization approach for the source identification of elliptic equations. This identification problem arises from two application backgrounds: actuator placement in PDE-constrained optimal controls and the regularized least-squares formulation of source identifications. The optimization problem seeks both the source strength and its support. By eliminating the variable associated with the source strength, we reduce the problem to a shape optimization problem for a coupled elliptic system, known as the first-order optimality system. As a model problem, we derive the shape derivative for the regularized least-squares formulation of the inverse source problem and propose a gradient descent shape optimization algorithm, implemented using the level-set method. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Landscape More Secure Than Portrait? Zooming Into the Directionality of Digital Images With Security Implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15206v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The orientation in which a source image is captured can affect the resulting security in downstream applications. One reason for this is that many state-of-the-art methods in media security assume that image statistics are similar in the horizontal and vertical directions, allowing them to reduce the number of features (or trainable weights) by merging coefficients. We show that this artificial symmetrization tends to suppress important properties of natural images and common processing operations, causing a loss of performance. We also observe the opposite problem, where unaddressed directionality causes learning-based methods to overfit to a single orientation. These are vulnerable to manipulation if an adversary chooses inputs with the less common orientation. This paper takes a comprehensive approach, identifies and systematizes causes of directionality at several stages of a typical acquisition pipeline, measures their effect, and demonstrates for three selected security applications (steganalysis, forensic source identification, and the detection of synthetic images) how the performance of state-of-the-art methods can be improved by properly accounting for directionality.</p></details> |  |
| **[DREW : Towards Robust Data Provenance by Leveraging Error-Controlled Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02836v2)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the origin of data is crucial for data provenance, with applications including data ownership protection, media forensics, and detecting AI-generated content. A standard approach involves embedding-based retrieval techniques that match query data with entries in a reference dataset. However, this method is not robust against benign and malicious edits. To address this, we propose Data Retrieval with Error-corrected codes and Watermarking (DREW). DREW randomly clusters the reference dataset, injects unique error-controlled watermark keys into each cluster, and uses these keys at query time to identify the appropriate cluster for a given sample. After locating the relevant cluster, embedding vector similarity retrieval is performed within the cluster to find the most accurate matches. The integration of error control codes (ECC) ensures reliable cluster assignments, enabling the method to perform retrieval on the entire dataset in case the ECC algorithm cannot detect the correct cluster with high confidence. This makes DREW maintain baseline performance, while also providing opportunities for performance improvements due to the increased likelihood of correctly matching queries to their origin when performing retrieval on a smaller subset of the dataset. Depending on the watermark technique used, DREW can provide substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy (up to 40\% for some datasets and modification types) across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art embedding models (e.g., DinoV2, CLIP), making our method a promising solution for secure and reliable source identification.

| **[Distinguishing Neural Speech Synthesis Models Through Fingerprints in Speech Waveforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06780v2)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent strides in neural speech synthesis technologies, while enjoying widespread applications, have nonetheless introduced a series of challenges, spurring interest in the defence against the threat of misuse and abuse. Notably, source attribution of synthesized speech has value in forensics and intellectual property protection, but prior work in this area has certain limitations in scope. To address the gaps, we present our findings concerning the identification of the sources of synthesized speech in this paper. We investigate the existence of speech synthesis model fingerprints in the generated speech waveforms, with a focus on the acoustic model and the vocoder, and study the influence of each component on the fingerprint in the overall speech waveforms. Our research, conducted using the multi-speaker LibriTTS dataset, demonstrates two key insights: (1) vocoders and acoustic models impart distinct, model-specific fingerprints on the waveforms they generate, and (2) vocoder fingerprints are the more dominant of the two, and may mask the fingerprints from the acoustic model. These findings strongly suggest the existence of model-specific fingerprints for both the acoustic model and the vocoder, highlighting their potential utility in source identification applications.</p></details> | Accepted by CCL 2024 |
| **[Steganalysis on Digital Watermarking: Is Your Defense Truly Impervious?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09026v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital watermarking techniques are crucial for copyright protection and source identification of images, especially in the era of generative AI models. However, many existing watermarking methods, particularly content-agnostic approaches that embed fixed patterns regardless of image content, are vulnerable to steganalysis attacks that can extract and remove the watermark with minimal perceptual distortion. In this work, we categorize watermarking algorithms into content-adaptive and content-agnostic ones, and demonstrate how averaging a collection of watermarked images could reveal the underlying watermark pattern. We then leverage this extracted pattern for effective watermark removal under both graybox and blackbox settings, even when the collection contains multiple watermark patterns. For some algorithms like Tree-Ring watermarks, the extracted pattern can also forge convincing watermarks on clean images. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations across twelve watermarking methods highlight the threat posed by steganalysis to content-agnostic watermarks and the importance of designing watermarking techniques resilient to such analytical attacks. We propose security guidelines calling for using content-adaptive watermarking strategies and performing security evaluation against steganalysis. We also suggest multi-key assignments as potential mitigations against steganalysis vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |

DAGs can be used to model causal relationships among variables, but their nilpotent adjacency matrices pose unique challenges towards developing DAG signal processing and machine learning tools. To address this limitation, we harness recent advances offering alternative definitions of causal shifts and convolutions for signals on DAGs. We develop a novel convolutional graph neural network that integrates learnable DAG filters to account for the partial ordering induced by the graph topology, thus providing valuable inductive bias to learn effective representations of DAG-supported data. We discuss the salient advantages and potential limitations of the proposed DAG convolutional network (DCN) and evaluate its performance on two learning tasks using synthetic data: network diffusion estimation and source identification. DCN compares favorably relative to several baselines, showcasing its promising potential.</p></details> |  |

With the potential for misuse escalating, the importance of discerning whether texts are human-authored or generated by LLMs has become paramount. Several preceding studies have ventured to address this challenge by employing binary classifiers to differentiate between human-written and LLM-generated text. Nevertheless, the reliability of these classifiers has been subject to question. Given that consequential decisions may hinge on the outcome of such classification, it is imperative that text source detection is of high caliber. In light of this, the present paper introduces DeepTextMark, a deep learning-driven text watermarking methodology devised for text source identification. By leveraging Word2Vec and Sentence Encoding for watermark insertion, alongside a transformer-based classifier for watermark detection, DeepTextMark epitomizes a blend of blindness, robustness, imperceptibility, and reliability. As elaborated within the paper, these attributes are crucial for universal text source detection, with a particular emphasis in this paper on text produced by LLMs. DeepTextMark offers a viable "add-on" solution to prevailing text generation frameworks, requiring no direct access or alterations to the underlying text generation mechanism. Experimental evaluations underscore the high imperceptibility, elevated detection accuracy, augmented robustness, reliability, and swift execution of DeepTextMark.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accpeted for publication by IEEE Access</p></details> |

Although recent solutions have enhanced performance by leveraging deep neural networks, they often require complete user data. In this paper, we address a more challenging task, rumor source detection with incomplete user data, and propose a novel framework, i.e., Source Detection in Graphs with Incomplete Nodes via Positional Encoding and Attentive Fusion (GIN-SD), to tackle this challenge. Specifically, our approach utilizes a positional embedding module to distinguish nodes that are incomplete and employs a self-attention mechanism to focus on nodes with greater information transmission capacity. To mitigate the prediction bias caused by the significant disparity between the numbers of source and non-source nodes, we also introduce a class-balancing mechanism. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of GIN-SD and its superiority to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by AAAI24</p></details> |

In this paper, we define input sentences that contain essential information in the generated summary as $\textit{source sentences}$ and study how abstractive summaries are made by analyzing the source sentences. To this end, we annotate source sentences for reference summaries and system summaries generated by PEGASUS on document-summary pairs sampled from the CNN/DailyMail and XSum datasets. We also formulate automatic source sentence detection and compare multiple methods to establish a strong baseline for the task. Experimental results show that the perplexity-based method performs well in highly abstractive settings, while similarity-based methods perform robustly in relatively extractive settings.

LLM-integrated applications serve as middleware to refine users' queries with domain-specific knowledge to better inform LLMs and enhance the responses. Despite numerous opportunities and benefits, LLM-integrated applications also introduce new attack surfaces. Understanding, minimizing, and eliminating these emerging attack surfaces is a new area of research. In this work, we consider a setup where the user and LLM interact via an LLM-integrated application in the middle. We focus on the communication rounds that begin with user's queries and end with LLM-integrated application returning responses to the queries, powered by LLMs at the service backend. For this query-response protocol, we identify potential vulnerabilities that can originate from the malicious application developer or from an outsider threat initiator that is able to control the database access, manipulate and poison data that are high-risk for the user. Successful exploits of the identified vulnerabilities result in the users receiving responses tailored to the intent of a threat initiator. We assess such threats against LLM-integrated applications empowered by OpenAI GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Our empirical results show that the threats can effectively bypass the restrictions and moderation policies of OpenAI, resulting in users receiving responses that contain bias, toxic content, privacy risk, and disinformation. To mitigate those threats, we identify and define four key properties, namely integrity, source identification, attack detectability, and utility preservation, that need to be satisfied by a safe LLM-integrated application. Based on these properties, we develop a lightweight, threat-agnostic defense that mitigates both insider and outsider threats.</p></details> |  |

In the algorithm, the mobile sensors perform source identification/localization to estimate the source location; meanwhile, they move to new locations to maximize the Fisher information about the source contained in the sensor measurements. In doing so, they improve the source location estimate and move closer to the source. Our algorithm is superior in convergence speed compared with traditional field climbing algorithms, is flexible in the measurement model and the choice of information metric, and is robust to measurement model errors. Moreover, we provide a fully distributed version of our algorithm, where each sensor decides its own actions and only shares information with its neighbors through a sparse communication network. We perform intensive simulation experiments to test our algorithms on large-scale systems and physical experiments on small ground vehicles with light sensors, demonstrating success in seeking a light source.</p></details> |  |

Although it is widely acknowledged that random and local gossip communications make source identification difficult, there exists no general quantification of the level of anonymity provided to the source. This paper presents a principled method based on $\varepsilon$-differential privacy to analyze the inherent source anonymity of gossiping for a large class of graphs. First, we quantify the fundamental limit of source anonymity any gossip protocol can guarantee in an arbitrary communication graph. In particular, our result indicates that when the graph has poor connectivity, no gossip protocol can guarantee any meaningful level of differential privacy. This prompted us to further analyze graphs with controlled connectivity. We prove on these graphs that a large class of gossip protocols, namely cobra walks, offers tangible differential privacy guarantees to the source. In doing so, we introduce an original proof technique based on the reduction of a gossip protocol to what we call a random walk with probabilistic die out. This proof technique is of independent interest to the gossip community and readily extends to other protocols inherited from the security community, such as the Dandelion protocol. Interestingly, our tight analysis precisely captures the trade-off between dissemination time of a gossip protocol and its source anonymity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of DISC2023 paper</p></details> |

Self-supervision tasks are often used to pre-train a neural network with a large amount of unlabeled data and extract generic features of the dataset. The learned model is likely to contain useful information which can be transferred to the downstream main task and improve performance compared to random parameter initialization. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervision task called source identification (SI), which is inspired by the classic blind source separation problem. Synthetic images are generated by fusing multiple source images and the network's task is to reconstruct the original images, given the fused images. A proper understanding of the image content is required to successfully solve the task. We validate our method on two medical image segmentation tasks: brain tumor segmentation and white matter hyperintensities segmentation. The results show that the proposed SI task outperforms traditional self-supervision tasks for dense predictions including inpainting, pixel shuffling, intensity shift, and super-resolution. Among variations of the SI task fusing images of different types, fusing images from different patients performs best.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Sequential Attention Source Identification Based on Feature Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15886v1)** | 2023-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snapshot observation based source localization has been widely studied due to its accessibility and low cost. However, the interaction of users in existing methods does not be addressed in time-varying infection scenarios. So these methods have a decreased accuracy in heterogeneous interaction scenarios. To solve this critical issue, this paper proposes a sequence-to-sequence based localization framework called Temporal-sequence based Graph Attention Source Identification (TGASI) based on an inductive learning idea. More specifically, the encoder focuses on generating multiple features by estimating the influence probability between two users, and the decoder distinguishes the importance of prediction sources in different timestamps by a designed temporal attention mechanism. It's worth mentioning that the inductive learning idea ensures that TGASI can detect the sources in new scenarios without knowing other prior knowledge, which proves the scalability of TGASI. Comprehensive experiments with the SOTA methods demonstrate the higher detection performance and scalability in different scenarios of TGASI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weighted sparsity regularization for source identification for elliptic PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11280v5)** | 2023-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This investigation is motivated by PDE-constrained optimization problems arising in connection with electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electroencephalography (EEG). Standard sparsity regularization does not necessarily produce adequate results for these applications because only boundary data/observations are available for the identification of the unknown source, which may be interior. We therefore study a weighted $\ell^1$-regularization technique for solving inverse problems when the forward operator has a significant null space. In particular, we prove that a sparse source, regardless of whether it is interior or located at the boundary, can be exactly recovered with this weighting procedure as the regularization parameter $\alpha$ tends to zero. Our analysis is supported by numerical experiments for cases with one and several local sources. The theory is developed in terms of Euclidean spaces, and our results can therefore be applied to many problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving High-Dimensional Inverse Problems with Auxiliary Uncertainty via Operator Learning with Limited Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11379v1)** | 2023-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex large-scale systems such as climate, important effects are caused by a combination of confounding processes that are not fully observable. The identification of sources from observations of system state is vital for attribution and prediction, which inform critical policy decisions. The difficulty of these types of inverse problems lies in the inability to isolate sources and the cost of simulating computational models. Surrogate models may enable the many-query algorithms required for source identification, but data challenges arise from high dimensionality of the state and source, limited ensembles of costly model simulations to train a surrogate model, and few and potentially noisy state observations for inversion due to measurement limitations. The influence of auxiliary processes adds an additional layer of uncertainty that further confounds source identification. We introduce a framework based on (1) calibrating deep neural network surrogates to the flow maps provided by an ensemble of simulations obtained by varying sources, and (2) using these surrogates in a Bayesian framework to identify sources from observations via optimization. Focusing on an atmospheric dispersion exemplar, we find that the expressive and computationally efficient nature of the deep neural network operator surrogates in appropriately reduced dimension allows for source identification with uncertainty quantification using limited data. Introducing a variable wind field as an auxiliary process, we find that a Bayesian approximation error approach is essential for reliable source inversion when uncertainty due to wind stresses the algorithm.</p></details> | 29 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Box constraints and weighted sparsity regularization for identifying sources in elliptic PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06069v2)** | 2023-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the possibility for using boundary data to identify sources in elliptic PDEs. Even though the associated forward operator has a large null space, it turns out that box constraints, combined with weighted sparsity regularization, can enable rather accurate recovery of sources with constant magnitude/strength. In addition, for sources with varying strength, the support of the inverse solution will be a subset of the support of the true source. We present both an analysis of the problem and a series of numerical experiments. Our work only addresses discretized problems. The reason for introducing the weighting procedure is that standard (unweighted) sparsity regularization fails to provide adequate results for the source identification task considered in this paper. This investigation is also motivated by applications, e.g., recovering mass distributions from measurements of gravitational fields and inverse scattering. We develop the methodology and the analysis in terms of Euclidean spaces, and our results can therefore be applied to many problems. For example, the results are equally applicable to models involving the screened Poisson equation as to models using the Helmholtz equation, with both large and small wave numbers.</p></details> |  |

Source camera identification of web photos aims to establish a reliable linkage from the captured images to their source cameras, and has a broad range of applications, such as image copyright protection, user authentication, investigated evidence verification, etc. This paper presents an innovative and practical source identification framework that employs neural-network enhanced sensor pattern noise to trace back web photos efficiently while ensuring security. Our proposed framework consists of three main stages: initial device fingerprint registration, fingerprint extraction and cryptographic connection establishment while taking photos, and connection verification between photos and source devices. By incorporating metric learning and frequency consistency into the deep network design, our proposed fingerprint extraction algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on modern smartphone photos for reliable source identification. Meanwhile, we also propose several optimization sub-modules to prevent fingerprint leakage and improve accuracy and efficiency. Finally for practical system design, two cryptographic schemes are introduced to reliably identify the correlation between registered fingerprint and verified photo fingerprint, i.e. fuzzy extractor and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). The codes for fingerprint extraction network and benchmark dataset with modern smartphone cameras photos are all publicly available at https://github.com/PhotoNecf/PhotoNecf.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW2023 (https://www2023.thewebconf.org/).

| **[Identification of Power System Oscillation Modes using Blind Source Separation based on Copula Statistic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03633v1)** | 2023-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamics of a power system with large penetration of renewable energy resources are becoming more nonlinear due to the intermittence of these resources and the switching of their power electronic devices. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately identify the dynamical modes of oscillation of such a power system when it is subject to disturbances to initiate appropriate preventive or corrective control actions. In this paper, we propose a high-order blind source identification (HOBI) algorithm based on the copula statistic to address these non-linear dynamics in modal analysis. The method combined with Hilbert transform (HOBI-HT) and iteration procedure (HOBMI) can identify all the modes as well as the model order from the observation signals obtained from the number of channels as low as one. We access the performance of the proposed method on numerical simulation signals and recorded data from a simulation of time domain analysis on the classical 11-Bus 4-Machine test system. Our simulation results outperform the state-of-the-art method in accuracy and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE PES General Meeting 2023</p></details> |

The recording device source features include spatial information and certain temporal information. However, most recording device source identification methods based on deep learning only use spatial representation learning from recording device source features, which cannot make full use of recording device source information. Therefore, in this paper, to fully explore the spatial information and temporal information of recording device source, we propose a new method for recording device source identification based on the fusion of spatial feature information and temporal feature information by using an end-to-end framework. From a feature perspective, we designed two kinds of networks to extract recording device source spatial and temporal information. Afterward, we use the attention mechanism to adaptively assign the weight of spatial information and temporal information to obtain fusion features. From a model perspective, our model uses an end-to-end framework to learn the deep representation from spatial feature and temporal feature and train using deep and shallow loss to joint optimize our network. This method is compared with our previous work and baseline system. The results show that the proposed method is better than our previous work and baseline system under general conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, recording device identification</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Object Detection Approaches to Signal Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16173v2)** | 2022-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally source identification is solved using threshold based energy detection algorithms. These algorithms frequently sum up the activity in regions, and consider regions above a specific activity threshold to be sources. While these algorithms work for the majority of cases, they often fail to detect signals that occupy small frequency bands, fail to distinguish sources with overlapping frequency bands, and cannot detect any signals under a specified signal to noise ratio. Through the conversion of raw signal data to spectrogram, source identification can be framed as an object detection problem. By leveraging modern advancements in deep learning based object detection, we propose a system that manages to alleviate the failure cases encountered when using traditional source identification algorithms. Our contributions include framing source identification as an object detection problem, the publication of a spectrogram object detection dataset, and evaluation of the RetinaNet and YOLOv5 object detection models trained on the dataset. Our final models achieve Mean Average Precisions of up to 0.906. With such a high Mean Average Precision, these models are sufficiently robust for use in real world applications.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the latest technology potentially enables new digital ways to lie. In response, the need for a diverse and reliable method toolbox arises to identify artificial images and other content. Previous work primarily relies on pixel-space CNNs or the Fourier transform. To the best of our knowledge, synthesized fake image analysis and detection methods based on a multi-scale wavelet representation, localized in both space and frequency, have been absent thus far. The wavelet transform conserves spatial information to a degree, which allows us to present a new analysis. Comparing the wavelet coefficients of real and fake images allows interpretation. Significant differences are identified. Additionally, this paper proposes to learn a model for the detection of synthetic images based on the wavelet-packet representation of natural and GAN-generated images. Our lightweight forensic classifiers exhibit competitive or improved performance at comparatively small network sizes, as we demonstrate on the FFHQ, CelebA and LSUN source identification problems.

| **[GPU-accelerated SIFT-aided source identification of stabilized videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14507v1)** | 2022-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video stabilization is an in-camera processing commonly applied by modern acquisition devices. While significantly improving the visual quality of the resulting videos, it has been shown that such operation typically hinders the forensic analysis of video signals. In fact, the correct identification of the acquisition source usually based on Photo Response non-Uniformity (PRNU) is subject to the estimation of the transformation applied to each frame in the stabilization phase. A number of techniques have been proposed for dealing with this problem, which however typically suffer from a high computational burden due to the grid search in the space of inversion parameters. Our work attempts to alleviate these shortcomings by exploiting the parallelization capabilities of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), typically used for deep learning applications, in the framework of stabilised frames inversion. Moreover, we propose to exploit SIFT features {to estimate the camera momentum and} %to identify less stabilized temporal segments, thus enabling a more accurate identification analysis, and to efficiently initialize the frame-wise parameter search of consecutive frames. Experiments on a consolidated benchmark dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the required computational time and improving the source identification accuracy. {The code is available at \url{https://github.com/AMontiB/GPU-PRNU-SIFT}}.</p></details> |  |

In addition to the problem of over-exploitation, in total disagreement with the concept of sustainable development, another not negligible issue concerns the groundwater contamination. Mainly, this aspect is due to intensive agricultural activities or industrialized areas. In literature, several papers have dealt with transport problem, especially for inverse problems in which the release history or the source location are identified. The innovative aim of the paper is to develop a data-driven model that is able to analyze multiple scenarios, even strongly non-linear, in order to solve forward and inverse transport problems, preserving the reliability of the results and reducing the uncertainty. Furthermore, this tool has the characteristic of providing extremely fast responses, essential to identify remediation strategies immediately. The advantages produced by the model were compared with literature studies. In this regard, a feedforward artificial neural network, which has been trained to handle different cases, represents the data-driven model. Firstly, to identify the concentration of the pollutant at specific observation points in the study area (forward problem); secondly, to deal with inverse problems identifying the release history at known source location; then, in case of one contaminant source, identifying the release history and, at the same time, the location of the source in a specific sub-domain of the investigated area. At last, the observation error is investigated and estimated. The results are satisfactorily achieved, highlighting the capability of the ANN to deal with multiple scenarios by approximating nonlinear functions without the physical point of view that describes the phenomenon, providing reliable results, with very low computational burden and uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Journal of Hydrology</p></details> |

In the frequency domain aeroacoustic sound propagation can be modelled as a random source problem for a convected Helmholtz equation. This article is concerned with the inverse random source problem to recover the support of an uncorrelated aeroacoustic source from correlations of observed pressure signals. We show that a variant of the factorization method from inverse scattering theory can be used for this purpose. We also discuss a surprising relation between the factorization method and a commonly used beamforming algorithm from experimental aeroacoustics, which is known as Capon's method or as the minimum variance method. Numerical examples illustrate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

| **[On the Exploitation of Deepfake Model Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04513v1)** | 2022-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with special focus to the Deepfake phenomenon there is no a clear understanding neither in terms of explainability nor of recognition of the involved models. In particular, the recognition of a specific GAN model that generated the deepfake image compared to many other possible models created by the same generative architecture (e.g. StyleGAN) is a task not yet completely addressed in the state-of-the-art. In this work, a robust processing pipeline to evaluate the possibility to point-out analytic fingerprints for Deepfake model recognition is presented. After exploiting the latent space of 50 slightly different models through an in-depth analysis on the generated images, a proper encoder was trained to discriminate among these models obtaining a classification accuracy of over 96%. Once demonstrated the possibility to discriminate extremely similar images, a dedicated metric exploiting the insights discovered in the latent space was introduced. By achieving a final accuracy of more than 94% for the Model Recognition task on images generated by models not employed in the training phase, this study takes an important step in countering the Deepfake phenomenon introducing a sort of signature in some sense similar to those employed in the multimedia forensics field (e.g. for camera source identification task, image ballistics task, etc).</p></details> |  |
| **[Online non-convex learning for river pollution source identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11065v2)** | 2022-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, novel gradient-based online learning algorithms are developed to investigate an important environmental application: real-time river pollution source identification, which aims at estimating the released mass, location, and time of a river pollution source based on downstream sensor data monitoring the pollution concentration. The pollution is assumed to be instantaneously released once. The problem can be formulated as a non-convex loss minimization problem in statistical learning, and our online algorithms have vectorized and adaptive step sizes to ensure high estimation accuracy in three dimensions which have different magnitudes. In order to keep the algorithm from stucking to the saddle points of non-convex loss, the escaping from saddle points module and multi-start setting are derived to further improve the estimation accuracy by searching for the global minimizer of the loss functions. This can be shown theoretically and experimentally as the $O(N)$ local regret of the algorithms and the high probability cumulative regret bound $O(N)$ under a particular error bound condition in loss functions. A real-life river pollution source identification example shows the superior performance of our algorithms compared to existing methods in terms of estimation accuracy. Managerial insights for the decision maker to use the algorithms are also provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[The power of adaptivity in source identification with time queries on the path](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07336v4)** | 2021-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of identifying the source of a stochastic diffusion process spreading on a graph based on the arrival times of the diffusion at a few queried nodes. In a graph $G=(V,E)$, an unknown source node $v^* \in V$ is drawn uniformly at random, and unknown edge weights $w(e)$ for $e\in E$, representing the propagation delays along the edges, are drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution of mean $1$ and variance $\sigma^2$. An algorithm then attempts to identify $v^*$ by querying nodes $q \in V$ and being told the length of the shortest path between $q$ and $v^*$ in graph $G$ weighted by $w$. We consider two settings: non-adaptive, in which all query nodes must be decided in advance, and adaptive, in which each query can depend on the results of the previous ones. Both settings are motivated by an application of the problem to epidemic processes (where the source is called patient zero), which we discuss in detail. We characterize the query complexity when $G$ is an $n$-node path. In the non-adaptive setting, $\Theta(n\sigma^2)$ queries are needed for $\sigma^2 \leq 1$, and $\Theta(n)$ for $\sigma^2 \geq 1$. In the adaptive setting, somewhat surprisingly, only $\Theta(\log\log_{1/\sigma}n)$ are needed when $\sigma^2 \leq 1/2$, and $\Theta(\log \log n)+O_\sigma(1)$ when $\sigma^2 \geq 1/2$. This is the first mathematical study of source identification with time queries in a non-deterministic diffusion process.</p></details> |  |

In this work we are concerned with the determination of a time-dependent source in a transport equation from noisy data measured at a fixed position. By means of Fourier techniques can be shown that the problem is ill-posed in the sense that the solution exists but it does not vary continuously with the data. A number of different techniques were developed by other authors to approximate the solution. In this work, we consider a family of parametric regularization operators to deal with the ill-posedness of the problem. We proposed a manner to select the regularization parameter as a function of noise level in data in order to obtain a regularized solution that approximate the unknown source. We find a H\"older type bound for the error of the approximated source when the unknown function is considered to be bounded in a given norm. Numerical examples illustrate the convergence and stability of the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages, 2 Figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |

We first put forward a unified information diffusion concept in terms of three components: information, user decision, and social vectors, followed by a detailed introduction of the methodologies for diffusion modeling. And then, a new taxonomy adopting hybrid philosophy (\textit{i.e.,} granularity and techniques) is proposed, and we made a series of comparative studies on elementary diffusion models under our taxonomy from the aspects of assumptions, methods, and pros and cons. We further summarized representative diffusion modeling in special scenarios and significant downstream tasks based on these elementary models.

Though the core dynamics follows some principles of physics, real-world physical processes are often driven by unknown external sources. In such cases, developing a purely analytical model becomes very difficult and data-driven modeling can be of assistance. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework combining physics-based numerical models with deep learning for source identification and forecasting of spatio-temporal dynamical systems with unobservable time-varying external sources. We formulate our model PhICNet as a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN) which is end-to-end trainable for spatio-temporal evolution prediction of dynamical systems and learns the source behavior as an internal state of the RNN. Experimental results show that the proposed model can forecast the dynamics for a relatively long time and identify the sources as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 16 figures.

The process of uploading and sharing data tends to hinder standard media forensic analyses, since multiple re-sharing steps progressively hide the traces of past manipulations. At the same time though, new traces are introduced by the platforms themselves, enabling the reconstruction of the sharing history of digital objects, with possible applications in information flow monitoring and source identification. In this work, we propose a supervised framework for the reconstruction of image sharing chains on social media platforms. The system is structured as a cascade of backtracking blocks, each of them tracing back one step of the sharing chain at a time. Blocks are designed as ensembles of classifiers trained to analyse the input image independently from one another by leveraging different feature representations that describe both content and container of the media object. Individual decisions are then properly combined by a late fusion strategy. Results highlight the advantages of employing multiple clues, which allow accurately tracing back up to three steps along the sharing chain.</p></details> |  |

Diffusive capture problems are computationally challenging due to the complex geometry and the applied boundary conditions together with intrinsically long transients that occur before a particle is captured. This paper reports on a particle-based Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that provides rapid accurate simulation of arrival statistics for (i) a half-space bounded by a surface with a finite collection of absorbing traps and (ii) the domain exterior to a convex cell again with absorbing traps. We validate our method by replicating classical results and in addition, newly developed boundary homogenization theories and matched asymptotic expansions on capture rates. In the case of non-spherical domains, we describe a new shielding effect in which geometry can play a role in sharpening cellular estimates on the directionality of diffusive sources.</p></details> | 32 pages, 10 figures |

Conventional manual cataloging methodologies are anticipated to be insufficient to exploit the capabilities of new radio surveys. Radio interferometric images of diffuse sources present a challenge for image segmentation tasks due to noise, artifacts, and embedded radio sources. In response to these challenges, we introduce Radio U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture. Radio U-Net is designed to detect faint and extended sources in radio surveys, such as radio halos, relics, and cosmic web filaments. Radio U-Net was trained on synthetic radio observations built upon cosmological simulations and then tested on a sample of galaxy clusters, where the detection of cluster diffuse radio sources relied on customized data reduction and visual inspection of LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data. The 83% of clusters exhibiting diffuse radio emission were accurately identified, and the segmentation successfully recovered the morphology of the sources even in low-quality images. In a test sample comprising 246 galaxy clusters, we achieved a 73% accuracy rate in distinguishing between clusters with and without diffuse radio emission. Our results establish the applicability of Radio U-Net to extensive radio survey datasets, probing its efficiency on cutting-edge high-performance computing systems. This approach represents an advancement in optimizing the exploitation of forthcoming large radio surveys for scientific exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MNRAS, 16 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Source Localization for Cross Network Information Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14668v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source localization aims to locate information diffusion sources only given the diffusion observation, which has attracted extensive attention in the past few years. Existing methods are mostly tailored for single networks and may not be generalized to handle more complex networks like cross-networks. Cross-network is defined as two interconnected networks, where one network's functionality depends on the other. Source localization on cross-networks entails locating diffusion sources on the source network by only giving the diffused observation in the target network. The task is challenging due to challenges including: 1) diffusion sources distribution modeling; 2) jointly considering both static and dynamic node features; and 3) heterogeneous diffusion patterns learning. In this work, we propose a novel method, namely CNSL, to handle the three primary challenges. Specifically, we propose to learn the distribution of diffusion sources through Bayesian inference and leverage disentangled encoders to separately learn static and dynamic node features. The learning objective is coupled with the cross-network information propagation estimation model to make the inference of diffusion sources considering the overall diffusion process. Additionally, we also provide two novel cross-network datasets collected by ourselves. Extensive experiments are conducted on both datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{CNSL} in handling the source localization on cross-networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data are available at: https://github.com/tanmoysr/CNSL/</p></details> |

Recent advances of cross-modal foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have made this problem feasible. Those approaches commonly leverage CLIP to align the holistic semantics of stylized mesh with the given text prompt. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to enable more controllable stylization of fine-grained details in 3D meshes solely based on such semantic-level cross-modal supervision. In this work, we propose a new 3DStyle-Diffusion model that triggers fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes with additional controllable appearance and geometric guidance from 2D Diffusion models. Technically, 3DStyle-Diffusion first parameterizes the texture of 3D mesh into reflectance properties and scene lighting using implicit MLP networks. Meanwhile, an accurate depth map of each sampled view is achieved conditioned on 3D mesh. Then, 3DStyle-Diffusion leverages a pre-trained controllable 2D Diffusion model to guide the learning of rendered images, encouraging the synthesized image of each view semantically aligned with text prompt and geometrically consistent with depth map. This way elegantly integrates both image rendering via implicit MLP networks and diffusion process of image synthesis in an end-to-end fashion, enabling a high-quality fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes. We also build a new dataset derived from Objaverse and the evaluation protocol for this task. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we validate the capability of our 3DStyle-Diffusion.

Characterizing the virality and growth of cascades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01027v3)** | 2022-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying the virality of cascades is an important question across disciplines such as the transmission of disease, the spread of information and the diffusion of innovations. An appropriate virality metric should be able to disambiguate between a shallow, broadcast-like diffusion process and a deep, multi-generational branching process. Although several valuable works have been dedicated to this field, most of them fail to take the position of the diffusion source into consideration, which makes them fall into the trap of graph isomorphism and would result in imprecise estimation of cascade virality inevitably under certain circumstances. In this paper, we propose a root-aware approach to quantifying the virality of cascades with proper consideration of the root node in a diffusion tree. With applications on synthetic and empirical cascades, we show the properties and potential utility of the proposed virality measure. Based on preferential attachment mechanisms, we further introduce a model to mimic the growth of cascades. The proposed model enables the interpolation between broadcast and viral spreading during the growth of cascades. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in characterizing the virality of growing cascades. Our work contributes to the understanding of cascade virality and growth, and could offer practical implications in a range of policy domains including viral marketing, infectious disease and information diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Source Localization of Graph Diffusion via Variational Autoencoders for Graph Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12327v1)** | 2022-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph diffusion problems such as the propagation of rumors, computer viruses, or smart grid failures are ubiquitous and societal. Hence it is usually crucial to identify diffusion sources according to the current graph diffusion observations. Despite its tremendous necessity and significance in practice, source localization, as the inverse problem of graph diffusion, is extremely challenging as it is ill-posed: different sources may lead to the same graph diffusion patterns. Different from most traditional source localization methods, this paper focuses on a probabilistic manner to account for the uncertainty of different candidate sources. Such endeavors require overcoming challenges including 1) the uncertainty in graph diffusion source localization is hard to be quantified; 2) the complex patterns of the graph diffusion sources are difficult to be probabilistically characterized; 3) the generalization under any underlying diffusion patterns is hard to be imposed. To solve the above challenges, this paper presents a generic framework: Source Localization Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) for locating the diffusion sources under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Particularly, we propose a probabilistic model that leverages the forward diffusion estimation model along with deep generative models to approximate the diffusion source distribution for quantifying the uncertainty. SL-VAE further utilizes prior knowledge of the source-observation pairs to characterize the complex patterns of diffusion sources by a learned generative prior. Lastly, a unified objective that integrates the forward diffusion estimation model is derived to enforce the model to generalize under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted on 7 real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SL-VAE in reconstructing the diffusion sources by excelling other methods on average 20% in AUC score.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, accepted by SIGKDD 2022</p></details> |

In particular, we formulate a candidate set which contains the diffusion source for sure, and propose the method, Percolation-based Evolutionary Framework (PrEF), to minimize such set. Hence one could further conduct more intensive investigation on only a few nodes to target the source. To achieve that, we first demonstrate that there are some similarities between the DSL problem and the network immunization problem. We find that the minimization of the candidate set is equivalent to the minimization of the order parameter if we view the observer set as the removal node set. Hence, PrEF is developed based on the network percolation and evolutionary algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on both model and empirical networks in regard to varied circumstances. Our results show that the developed approach could achieve a much smaller candidate set compared to the state of the art in almost all cases. Meanwhile, our approach is also more stable, i.e., it has similar performance irrespective of varied infection probabilities, diffusion models, and outbreak ranges. More importantly, our approach might provide a new framework to tackle the DSL problem in extreme large networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Social Diffusion Sources Can Escape Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10539v2)** | 2021-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influencing (and being influenced by) others through social networks is fundamental to all human societies. Whether this happens through the diffusion of rumors, opinions, or viruses, identifying the diffusion source (i.e., the person that initiated it) is a problem that has attracted much research interest. Nevertheless, existing literature has ignored the possibility that the source might strategically modify the network structure (by rewiring links or introducing fake nodes) to escape detection. Here, without restricting our analysis to any particular diffusion scenario, we close this gap by evaluating two mechanisms that hide the source-one stemming from the source's actions, the other from the network structure itself. This reveals that sources can easily escape detection, and that removing links is far more effective than introducing fake nodes. Thus, efforts should focus on exposing concealed ties rather than planted entities; such exposure would drastically improve our chances of detecting the diffusion source.</p></details> | <details><summary>100 p...</summary><p>100 pages, 80 figures</p></details> |

In our application, denoising is intended to address both the reduction of random instrumental noise and the minimisation of additional spurious artefacts like the sidelobes, resulting from the aperture synthesis technique. The effectiveness and the accuracy of the method are analysed for different kinds of corrupted input images, together with its computational performance. Specific attention has been devoted to create realistic mock observations for the training, exploiting the outcomes of cosmological numerical simulations, to generate images corresponding to LOFAR HBA 8 hours observations at 150 MHz. Our autoencoder can effectively denoise complex images identifying and extracting faint objects at the limits of the instrumental sensitivity. The method can efficiently scale on large datasets, exploiting high performance computing solutions, in a fully automated way (i.e. no human supervision is required after training). It can accurately perform image segmentation, identifying low brightness outskirts of diffused sources, proving to be a viable solution for detecting challenging extended objects hidden in noisy radio observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, Accepted for publication by MNRAS</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Source Identification on Networks with Statistical Confidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04800v2)** | 2021-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion source identification on networks is a problem of fundamental importance in a broad class of applications, including rumor controlling and virus identification. Though this problem has received significant recent attention, most studies have focused only on very restrictive settings and lack theoretical guarantees for more realistic networks. We introduce a statistical framework for the study of diffusion source identification and develop a confidence set inference approach inspired by hypothesis testing. Our method efficiently produces a small subset of nodes, which provably covers the source node with any pre-specified confidence level without restrictive assumptions on network structures. Moreover, we propose multiple Monte Carlo strategies for the inference procedure based on network topology and the probabilistic properties that significantly improve the scalability. To our knowledge, this is the first diffusion source identification method with a practically useful theoretical guarantee on general networks. We demonstrate our approach via extensive synthetic experiments on well-known random network models and a mobility network between cities concerning the COVID-19 spreading.</p></details> |  |

We consider the case when respondents may not always be truthful and some cost is taken for each query.

Due to the abundance of fBm processes in nature, significant efforts have been devoted to the identification and characterization of fBm sources in various phenomena. In practice, the identification of the fBm sources often relies on solving a complex and ill-posed inverse problem based on limited observed data. In the general case, the detected signals are formed by an unknown number of release sources, located at different locations and with different strengths, that act simultaneously. This means that the observed data is composed of mixtures of releases from an unknown number of sources, which makes the traditional inverse modeling approaches unreliable. Here, we report an unsupervised learning method, based on Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, that enables the identification of the unknown number of release sources as well the anomalous diffusion characteristics based on limited observed data and the general form of the corresponding fBm Green's function. We show that our method performs accurately for different types of sources and configurations with a predetermined number of sources with specific characteristics and introduced noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in physical review research</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Localization of Diffusion Sources in Complex Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04915v1)** | 2017-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating sources of diffusion and spreading from minimum data is a significant problem in network science with great applied values to the society. However, a general theoretical framework dealing with optimal source localization is lacking. Combining the controllability theory for complex networks and compressive sensing, we develop a framework with high efficiency and robustness for optimal source localization in arbitrary weighted networks with arbitrary distribution of sources. We offer a minimum output analysis to quantify the source locatability through a minimal number of messenger nodes that produce sufficient measurement for fully locating the sources. When the minimum messenger nodes are discerned, the problem of optimal source localization becomes one of sparse signal reconstruction, which can be solved using compressive sensing. Application of our framework to model and empirical networks demonstrates that sources in homogeneous and denser networks are more readily to be located. A surprising finding is that, for a connected undirected network with random link weights and weak noise, a single messenger node is sufficient for locating any number of sources. The framework deepens our understanding of the network source localization problem and offers efficient tools with broad applications.</p></details> | 6 figures |

We propose a new source localization algorithm, named Optimal-Jordan-Cover (OJC). The algorithm first extracts a subgraph using a candidate selection algorithm that selects source candidates based on the number of observed infected nodes in their neighborhoods. Then, in the extracted subgraph, OJC finds a set of nodes that "cover" all observed infected nodes with the minimum radius. The set of nodes is called the Jordan cover, and is regarded as the set of diffusion sources. Considering the heterogeneous susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) diffusion in the Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graph, we prove that OJC can locate all sources with probability one asymptotically with partial observations. OJC is a polynomial-time algorithm in terms of network size. However, the computational complexity increases exponentially in $m,$ the number of sources. We further propose a low-complexity heuristic based on the K-Means for approximating the Jordan cover, named Approximate-Jordan-Cover (AJC). Simulations on random graphs and real networks demonstrate that both AJC and OJC significantly outperform other heuristic algorithms.</p></details> | 16 figures |
| **[3D Stochastic Geometry Model for Large-Scale Molecular Communication Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08311v2)** | 2016-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information delivery using chemical molecules is an integral part of biology at multiple distance scales and has attracted recent interest in bioengineering and communication. The collective signal strength at the receiver (i.e., the expected number of observed molecules inside the receiver), resulting from a large number of transmitters at random distances (e.g., due to mobility), can have a major impact on the reliability and efficiency of the molecular communication system. Modeling the collective signal from multiple diffusion sources can be computationally and analytically challenging. In this paper, we present the first tractable analytical model for the collective signal strength due to randomly-placed transmitters, whose positions are modelled as a homogeneous Poisson point process in three-dimensional (3D) space. By applying stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions for the expected number of observed molecules at a fully absorbing receiver and a passive receiver. Our results reveal that the collective signal strength at both types of receivers increases proportionally with increasing transmitter density. The proposed framework dramatically simplifies the analysis of large-scale molecular systems in both communication and biological applications.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Existing approaches in rumor source detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study, we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion. Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach, showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI25 |
| **[Detection of Rumors and Their Sources in Social Networks: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05292v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent advancements in social network platform technology, an overwhelming amount of information is spreading rapidly. In this situation, it can become increasingly difficult to discern what information is false or true. If false information proliferates significantly, it can lead to undesirable outcomes. Hence, when we receive some information, we can pose the following two questions: $(i)$ Is the information true? $(ii)$ If not, who initially spread that information? % The first problem is the rumor detection issue, while the second is the rumor source detection problem. A rumor-detection problem involves identifying and mitigating false or misleading information spread via various communication channels, particularly online platforms and social media. Rumors can range from harmless ones to deliberately misleading content aimed at deceiving or manipulating audiences. Detecting misinformation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of information ecosystems and preventing harmful effects such as the spread of false beliefs, polarization, and even societal harm. Therefore, it is very important to quickly distinguish such misinformation while simultaneously finding its source to block it from spreading on the network. However, most of the existing surveys have analyzed these two issues separately. In this work, we first survey the existing research on the rumor-detection and rumor source detection problems with joint detection approaches, simultaneously. % This survey deals with these two issues together so that their relationship can be observed and it provides how the two problems are similar and different. The limitations arising from the rumor detection, rumor source detection, and their combination problems are also explained, and some challenges to be addressed in future works are presented.</p></details> |  |

Past research has indicated that content-based (i.e., using solely source posts as input) rumor detection models tend to perform less effectively on unseen rumors. At the same time, the potential of context-based models remains largely untapped. The main contribution of this paper is in the in-depth evaluation of the performance gap between content and context-based models specifically on detecting new, unseen rumors. Our empirical findings demonstrate that context-based models are still overly dependent on the information derived from the rumors' source post and tend to overlook the significant role that contextual information can play. We also study the effect of data split strategies on classifier performance. Based on our experimental results, the paper also offers practical suggestions on how to minimize the effects of temporal concept drift in static datasets during the training of rumor detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we address a more challenging task, rumor source detection with incomplete user data, and propose a novel framework, i.e., Source Detection in Graphs with Incomplete Nodes via Positional Encoding and Attentive Fusion (GIN-SD), to tackle this challenge. Specifically, our approach utilizes a positional embedding module to distinguish nodes that are incomplete and employs a self-attention mechanism to focus on nodes with greater information transmission capacity. To mitigate the prediction bias caused by the significant disparity between the numbers of source and non-source nodes, we also introduce a class-balancing mechanism.

In this model, a small subset of nodes from a network are the source of a rumor. In discrete time steps, each informed node "infects" each of its uninformed neighbors with probability $p$. While many facets of this process are studied in the literature, less is known about the inference problem: given a number of infected nodes in a network, can we learn the source of the rumor? In the context of epidemiology this problem is often referred to as patient zero problem. It belongs to a broader class of problems where the goal is to infer parameters of the underlying spreading model, see, e.g., Lokhov [NeurIPS'16] or Mastakouri et al. [NeurIPS'20]. In this work we present a maximum likelihood estimator for the rumor's source, given a snapshot of the process in terms of a set of active nodes $X$ after $t$ steps. Our results show that, for cycle-free graphs, the likelihood estimator undergoes a non-trivial phase transition as a function $t$. We provide a rigorous analysis for two prominent classes of acyclic network, namely $d$-regular trees and Galton-Watson trees, and verify empirically that our heuristics work well in various general networks.</p></details> |  |

Tremendous efforts have been devoted to this area to understand and quantify information diffusion dynamics. This survey investigates and summarizes the emerging distinguished works in diffusion modeling. We first put forward a unified information diffusion concept in terms of three components: information, user decision, and social vectors, followed by a detailed introduction of the methodologies for diffusion modeling. And then, a new taxonomy adopting hybrid philosophy (\textit{i.e.,} granularity and techniques) is proposed, and we made a series of comparative studies on elementary diffusion models under our taxonomy from the aspects of assumptions, methods, and pros and cons. We further summarized representative diffusion modeling in special scenarios and significant downstream tasks based on these elementary models.

| **[Rumor Source Detection under Querying with Untruthful Answers](http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05496v5)** | 2020-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social networks are the major routes for most individuals to exchange their opinions about new products, social trends and political issues via their interactions. It is often of significant importance to figure out who initially diffuses the information, ie, finding a rumor source or a trend setter. It is known that such a task is highly challenging and the source detection probability cannot be beyond 31 percent for regular trees, if we just estimate the source from a given diffusion snapshot. In practice, finding the source often entails the process of querying that asks "Are you the rumor source?" or "Who tells you the rumor?" that would increase the chance of detecting the source. In this paper, we consider two kinds of querying: (a) simple batch querying and (b) interactive querying with direction under the assumption that queries can be untruthful with some probability. We propose estimation algorithms for those queries, and quantify their detection performance and the amount of extra budget due to untruthfulness, analytically showing that querying significantly improves the detection performance. We perform extensive simulations to validate our theoretical findings over synthetic and real-world social network topologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rumor source detection with multiple observations under adaptive diffusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11211v1)** | 2020-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work, motivated by anonymous messaging platforms, has introduced adaptive diffusion protocols which can obfuscate the source of a rumor: a "snapshot adversary" with access to the subgraph of "infected" nodes can do no better than randomly guessing the entity of the source node. What happens if the adversary has access to multiple independent snapshots? We study this question when the underlying graph is the infinite $d$-regular tree. We show that (1) a weak form of source obfuscation is still possible in the case of two independent snapshots, but (2) already with three observations there is a simple algorithm that finds the rumor source with constant probability, regardless of the adaptive diffusion protocol. We also characterize the tradeoff between local spreading and source obfuscation for adaptive diffusion protocols (under a single snapshot). These results raise questions about the robustness of anonymity guarantees when spreading information in social networks.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

Most of the existing methods have largely worked on event-level detection that requires the collection of posts relevant to a specific event and relied only on user-generated content. They are not appropriate to detect rumor sources in the very early stages, before an event unfolds and becomes widespread. In this paper, we address the task of ERD at the message level. We present a novel hybrid neural network architecture, which combines a task-specific character-based bidirectional language model and stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to represent textual contents and social-temporal contexts of input source tweets, for modelling propagation patterns of rumors in the early stages of their development. We apply multi-layered attention models to jointly learn attentive context embeddings over multiple context inputs. Our experiments employ a stringent leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) evaluation setup on seven publicly available real-life rumor event data sets. Our models achieve state-of-the-art(SoA) performance for detecting unseen rumors on large augmented data which covers more than 12 events and 2,967 rumors. An ablation study is conducted to understand the relative contribution of each component of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted for publication at The LREC 2020 Proceedings.

| **[Neural Language Model Based Training Data Augmentation for Weakly Supervised Early Rumor Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07033v1)** | 2019-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity and class imbalance of training data are known issues in current rumor detection tasks. We propose a straight-forward and general-purpose data augmentation technique which is beneficial to early rumor detection relying on event propagation patterns. The key idea is to exploit massive unlabeled event data sets on social media to augment limited labeled rumor source tweets. This work is based on rumor spreading patterns revealed by recent rumor studies and semantic relatedness between labeled and unlabeled data. A state-of-the-art neural language model (NLM) and large credibility-focused Twitter corpora are employed to learn context-sensitive representations of rumor tweets. Six different real-world events based on three publicly available rumor datasets are employed in our experiments to provide a comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of the method. The results show that our method can expand the size of an existing rumor data set nearly by 200% and corresponding social context (i.e., conversational threads) by 100% with reasonable quality. Preliminary experiments with a state-of-the-art deep learning-based rumor detection model show that augmented data can alleviate over-fitting and class imbalance caused by limited train data and can help to train complex neural networks (NNs). With augmented data, the performance of rumor detection can be improved by 12.1% in terms of F-score. Our experiments also indicate that augmented training data can help to generalize rumor detection models on unseen rumors.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In this paper, we focus on a network represented by a regular tree which does not have any cycle and in which all nodes have the same number of edges connected to a node. For this network, we clarify that, with quite high probability, the origin node is within the distance 3 from the node selected by the optimal estimator, where the distance is the number of edges of the unique path connecting two nodes. This is clarified by the probability distribution of the distance between the origin and the selected node.</p></details> | <details><summary>fixed...</summary><p>fixed typos and proofs, 16 pages, 2 figures, a short version of this paper has been submitted to the 2019 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT 2019)</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Rumor Sources Using Dominant Eigenvalue of Nonbacktracking Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/1810.00659v1)** | 2018-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of identifying rumor sources in a network, in which rumor spreading obeys a time-slotted susceptible-infected model. Unlike existing approaches, our proposed algorithm identifies as sources those nodes, which when set as sources, result in the smallest dominant eigenvalue of the corresponding reduced nonbacktracking matrix deduced from message passing equations. We also propose a reduced-complexity algorithm derived from the previous algorithm through a perturbation approximation. Numerical experiments on synthesized and real-world networks suggest that these proposed algorithms generally have higher accuracy compared with representative existing algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at GlobalSIP 2018</p></details> |
| **[Hiding the Rumor Source](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02849v2)** | 2016-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anonymous social media platforms like Secret, Yik Yak, and Whisper have emerged as important tools for sharing ideas without the fear of judgment. Such anonymous platforms are also important in nations under authoritarian rule, where freedom of expression and the personal safety of message authors may depend on anonymity. Whether for fear of judgment or retribution, it is sometimes crucial to hide the identities of users who post sensitive messages. In this paper, we consider a global adversary who wishes to identify the author of a message; it observes either a snapshot of the spread of a message at a certain time, sampled timestamp metadata, or both. Recent advances in rumor source detection show that existing messaging protocols are vulnerable against such an adversary. We introduce a novel messaging protocol, which we call adaptive diffusion, and show that under the snapshot adversarial model, adaptive diffusion spreads content fast and achieves perfect obfuscation of the source when the underlying contact network is an infinite regular tree. That is, all users with the message are nearly equally likely to have been the origin of the message. When the contact network is an irregular tree, we characterize the probability of maximum likelihood detection by proving a concentration result over Galton-Watson trees. Experiments on a sampled Facebook network demonstrate that adaptive diffusion effectively hides the location of the source even when the graph is finite, irregular and has cycles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification of Source of Rumors in Social Networks with Incomplete Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00557v1)** | 2015-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rumor source identification in large social networks has received significant attention lately. Most recent works deal with the scale of the problem by observing a subset of the nodes in the network, called sensors, to estimate the source. This paper addresses the problem of locating the source of a rumor in large social networks where some of these sensor nodes have failed. We estimate the missing information about the sensors using doubly non-negative (DN) matrix completion and compressed sensing techniques. This is then used to identify the actual source by using a maximum likelihood estimator we developed earlier, on a large data set from Sina Weibo. Results indicate that the estimation techniques result in almost as good a performance of the ML estimator as for the network for which complete information is available. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work on source identification with incomplete information in social networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spy vs. Spy: Rumor Source Obfuscation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8439v3)** | 2015-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anonymous messaging platforms, such as Secret and Whisper, have emerged as important social media for sharing one's thoughts without the fear of being judged by friends, family, or the public. Further, such anonymous platforms are crucial in nations with authoritarian governments; the right to free expression and sometimes the personal safety of the author of the message depend on anonymity. Whether for fear of judgment or personal endangerment, it is crucial to keep anonymous the identity of the user who initially posted a sensitive message. In this paper, we consider an adversary who observes a snapshot of the spread of a message at a certain time. Recent advances in rumor source detection shows that the existing messaging protocols are vulnerable against such an adversary. We introduce a novel messaging protocol, which we call adaptive diffusion, and show that it spreads the messages fast and achieves a perfect obfuscation of the source when the underlying contact network is an infinite regular tree: all users with the message are nearly equally likely to have been the origin of the message. Experiments on a sampled Facebook network show that it effectively hides the location of the source even when the graph is finite, irregular and has cycles. We further consider a stronger adversarial model where a subset of colluding users track the reception of messages. We show that the adaptive diffusion provides a strong protection of the anonymity of the source even under this scenario.</p></details> | 14 pages 10 figures |
| **[Rooting out the Rumor Culprit from Suspects](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6312v4)** | 2013-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Suppose that a rumor originating from a single source among a set of suspects spreads in a network, how to root out this rumor source? With the a priori knowledge of suspect nodes and an observation of infected nodes, we construct a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to identify the rumor source using the susceptible-infected (SI) model. The a priori suspect set and its associated connectivity bring about new ingredients to the problem, and thus we propose to use local rumor center, a generalized concept based on rumor centrality, to identify the source from suspects. For regular tree-type networks of node degree {\delta}, we characterize Pc(n), the correct detection probability of the estimator upon observing n infected nodes, in both the finite and asymptotic regimes. First, when every infected node is a suspect, Pc(n) asymptotically grows from 0.25 to 0.307 with {\delta} from 3 to infinity, a result first established in Shah and Zaman (2011, 2012) via a different approach; and it monotonically decreases with n and increases with {\delta}. Second, when the suspects form a connected subgraph of the network, Pc(n) asymptotically significantly exceeds the a priori probability if {\delta}>2, and reliable detection is achieved as {\delta} becomes large; furthermore, it monotonically decreases with n and increases with {\delta}. Third, when there are only two suspects, Pc(n) is asymptotically at least 0.75 if {\delta}>2; and it increases with the distance between the two suspects. Fourth, when there are multiple suspects, among all possible connection patterns, that they form a connected subgraph of the network achieves the smallest detection probability. Our analysis leverages ideas from the Polya's urn model in probability theory and sheds insight into the behavior of the rumor spreading process not only in the asymptotic regime but also for the general finite-n regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |
| **[Rumors in a Network: Who's the Culprit?](http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4370v2)** | 2010-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a systematic study of the problem of finding the source of a rumor in a network. We model rumor spreading in a network with a variant of the popular SIR model and then construct an estimator for the rumor source. This estimator is based upon a novel topological quantity which we term \textbf{rumor centrality}. We establish that this is an ML estimator for a class of graphs. We find the following surprising threshold phenomenon: on trees which grow faster than a line, the estimator always has non-trivial detection probability, whereas on trees that grow like a line, the detection probability will go to 0 as the network grows. Simulations performed on synthetic networks such as the popular small-world and scale-free networks, and on real networks such as an internet AS network and the U.S. electric power grid network, show that the estimator either finds the source exactly or within a few hops of the true source across different network topologies. We compare rumor centrality to another common network centrality notion known as distance centrality. We prove that on trees, the rumor center and distance center are equivalent, but on general networks, they may differ. Indeed, simulations show that rumor centrality outperforms distance centrality in finding rumor sources in networks which are not tree-like.</p></details> | 43 pages, 13 figures |
