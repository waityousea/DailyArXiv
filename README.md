| **[Aeroacoustic Source Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.14276v2)** | 2023-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deconvolutional DAMAS algorithm can effectively eliminate the misconceptions in the usually-used beamforming localization algorithm, allowing for more accurate calculation of the source location as well as the intensity. When solving a linear system of equations, the DAMAS algorithm takes into account the mutual influence of different locations, reducing or even eliminating sidelobes and producing more accurate results. This work first introduces the principles of the DAMAS algorithm. Then it applies both the beamforming algorithm and the DAMAS algorithm to simulate the localization of a single-frequency source from a 1.5 MW wind turbine, a complex line source with the text "UCAS" and a line source downstream of an airfoil trailing edge. Finally, the work presents experimental localization results of the source of a 1.5 MW wind turbine using both the beamforming algorithm and the DAMAS algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Sound Source Localization for Unknown Number of Sources](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12273v1)** | 2022-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound source localization aims to seek the direction of arrival (DOA) of all sound sources from the observed multi-channel audio. For the practical problem of unknown number of sources, existing localization algorithms attempt to predict a likelihood-based coding (i.e., spatial spectrum) and employ a pre-determined threshold to detect the source number and corresponding DOA value. However, these threshold-based algorithms are not stable since they are limited by the careful choice of threshold. To address this problem, we propose an iterative sound source localization approach called ISSL, which can iteratively extract each source's DOA without threshold until the termination criterion is met. Unlike threshold-based algorithms, ISSL designs an active source detector network based on binary classifier to accept residual spatial spectrum and decide whether to stop the iteration. By doing so, our ISSL can deal with an arbitrary number of sources, even more than the number of sources seen during the training stage. The experimental results show that our ISSL achieves significant performance improvements in both DOA estimation and source number detection compared with the existing threshold-based algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2022</p></details> |
| **[Back to the Source: an Online Approach for Sensor Placement and Source Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01056v2)** | 2017-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source localization, the act of finding the originator of a disease or rumor in a network, has become an important problem in sociology and epidemiology. The localization is done using the infection state and time of infection of a few designated sensor nodes; however, maintaining sensors can be very costly in practice. We propose the first online approach to source localization: We deploy a priori only a small number of sensors (which reveal if they are reached by an infection) and then iteratively choose the best location to place new sensors in order to localize the source. This approach allows for source localization with a very small number of sensors; moreover, the source can be found while the epidemic is still ongoing. Our method applies to a general network topology and performs well even with random transmission delays.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at WWW '17</p></details> |
| **[GraphSL: An Open-Source Library for Graph Source Localization Approaches and Benchmark Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.03724v2)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GraphSL, a new library for studying the graph source localization problem. graph diffusion and graph source localization are inverse problems in nature: graph diffusion predicts information diffusions from information sources, while graph source localization predicts information sources from information diffusions. GraphSL facilitates the exploration of various graph diffusion models for simulating information diffusions and enables the evaluation of cutting-edge source localization approaches on established benchmark datasets. The source code of GraphSL is made available at Github Repository (https://github.com/xianggebenben/GraphSL).

| **[Optimal Localization of Diffusion Sources in Complex Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04915v1)** | 2017-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating sources of diffusion and spreading from minimum data is a significant problem in network science with great applied values to the society. However, a general theoretical framework dealing with optimal source localization is lacking. Combining the controllability theory for complex networks and compressive sensing, we develop a framework with high efficiency and robustness for optimal source localization in arbitrary weighted networks with arbitrary distribution of sources. We offer a minimum output analysis to quantify the source locatability through a minimal number of messenger nodes that produce sufficient measurement for fully locating the sources. When the minimum messenger nodes are discerned, the problem of optimal source localization becomes one of sparse signal reconstruction, which can be solved using compressive sensing. Application of our framework to model and empirical networks demonstrates that sources in homogeneous and denser networks are more readily to be located. A surprising finding is that, for a connected undirected network with random link weights and weak noise, a single messenger node is sufficient for locating any number of sources. The framework deepens our understanding of the network source localization problem and offers efficient tools with broad applications.</p></details> | 6 figures |
| **[Reflection-Aware Sound Source Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07791v1)** | 2017-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel, reflection-aware method for 3D sound localization in indoor environments. Unlike prior approaches, which are mainly based on continuous sound signals from a stationary source, our formulation is designed to localize the position instantaneously from signals within a single frame. We consider direct sound and indirect sound signals that reach the microphones after reflecting off surfaces such as ceilings or walls. We then generate and trace direct and reflected acoustic paths using inverse acoustic ray tracing and utilize these paths with Monte Carlo localization to estimate a 3D sound source position. We have implemented our method on a robot with a cube-shaped microphone array and tested it against different settings with continuous and intermittent sound signals with a stationary or a mobile source. Across different settings, our approach can localize the sound with an average distance error of 0.8m tested in a room of 7m by 7m area with 3m height, including a mobile and non-line-of-sight sound source. We also reveal that the modeling of indirect rays increases the localization accuracy by 40% compared to only using direct acoustic rays.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2018.

| **[Mix and Localize: Localizing Sound Sources in Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.15058v1)** | 2022-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for simultaneously localizing multiple sound sources within a visual scene. This task requires a model to both group a sound mixture into individual sources, and to associate them with a visual signal. Our method jointly solves both tasks at once, using a formulation inspired by the contrastive random walk of Jabri et al. We create a graph in which images and separated sounds correspond to nodes, and train a random walker to transition between nodes from different modalities with high return probability. The transition probabilities for this walk are determined by an audio-visual similarity metric that is learned by our model. We show through experiments with musical instruments and human speech that our model can successfully localize multiple sounds, outperforming other self-supervised methods.

| **[Multi-source adversarial transfer learning based on similar source domains with local features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.19067v2)** | 2023-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning leverages knowledge from other domains and has been successful in many applications. Transfer learning methods rely on the overall similarity of the source and target domains. However, in some cases, it is impossible to provide an overall similar source domain, and only some source domains with similar local features can be provided. Can transfer learning be achieved? In this regard, we propose a multi-source adversarial transfer learning method based on local feature similarity to the source domain to handle transfer scenarios where the source and target domains have only local similarities. This method extracts transferable local features between a single source domain and the target domain through a sub-network. Specifically, the feature extractor of the sub-network is induced by the domain discriminator to learn transferable knowledge between the source domain and the target domain. The extracted features are then weighted by an attention module to suppress non-transferable local features while enhancing transferable local features. In order to ensure that the data from the target domain in different sub-networks in the same batch is exactly the same, we designed a multi-source domain independent strategy to provide the possibility for later local feature fusion to complete the key features required. In order to verify the effectiveness of the method, we made the dataset "Local Carvana Image Masking Dataset". Applying the proposed method to the image segmentation task of the proposed dataset achieves better transfer performance than other multi-source transfer learning methods. It is shown that the designed transfer learning method is feasible for transfer scenarios where the source and target domains have only local similarities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Information Fusion</p></details> |
| **[The LOCATA Challenge: Acoustic Source Localization and Tracking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.01008v3)** | 2020-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to localize and track acoustic events is a fundamental prerequisite for equipping machines with the ability to be aware of and engage with humans in their surrounding environment. However, in realistic scenarios, audio signals are adversely affected by reverberation, noise, interference, and periods of speech inactivity. In dynamic scenarios, where the sources and microphone platforms may be moving, the signals are additionally affected by variations in the source-sensor geometries. In practice, approaches to sound source localization and tracking are often impeded by missing estimates of active sources, estimation errors, as well as false estimates. The aim of the LOCAlization and TrAcking (LOCATA) Challenge is an open-access framework for the objective evaluation and benchmarking of broad classes of algorithms for sound source localization and tracking. This article provides a review of relevant localization and tracking algorithms and, within the context of the existing literature, a detailed evaluation and dissemination of the LOCATA submissions. The evaluation highlights achievements in the field, open challenges, and identifies potential future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing</p></details> |
| **[Localization of Sound Sources in a Room with One Microphone](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.04504v1)** | 2017-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimation of the location of sound sources is usually done using microphone arrays. Such settings provide an environment where we know the difference between the received signals among different microphones in the terms of phase or attenuation, which enables localization of the sound sources. In our solution we exploit the properties of the room transfer function in order to localize a sound source inside a room with only one microphone. The shape of the room and the position of the microphone are assumed to be known. The design guidelines and limitations of the sensing matrix are given. Implementation is based on the sparsity in the terms of voxels in a room that are occupied by a source. What is especially interesting about our solution is that we provide localization of the sound sources not only in the horizontal plane, but in the terms of the 3D coordinates inside the room.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adjoint-Based Identification of Sound Sources for Sound Reinforcement and Source Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.08620v1)** | 2023-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The identification of sound sources is a common problem in acoustics. Different parameters are sought, among these are signal and position of the sources. We present an adjoint-based approach for sound source identification, which employs computational aeroacoustic techniques. Two different applications are presented as a proof-of-concept: optimization of a sound reinforcement setup and the localization of (moving) sound sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Bayesian Learning for EEG Source Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.04621v1)** | 2015-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Localizing the sources of electrical activity from electroencephalographic (EEG) data has gained considerable attention over the last few years. In this paper, we propose an innovative source localization method for EEG, based on Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL). Methods: To better specify the sparsity profile and to ensure efficient source localization, the proposed approach considers grouping of the electrical current dipoles inside human brain. SBL is used to solve the localization problem in addition with imposed constraint that the electric current dipoles associated with the brain activity are isotropic. Results: Numerical experiments are conducted on a realistic head model that is obtained by segmentation of MRI images of the head and includes four major components, namely the scalp, the skull, the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the brain, with appropriate relative conductivity values. The results demonstrate that the isotropy constraint significantly improves the performance of SBL. In a noiseless environment, the proposed method was 1 found to accurately (with accuracy of >75%) locate up to 6 simultaneously active sources, whereas for SBL without the isotropy constraint, the accuracy of finding just 3 simultaneously active sources was <75%. Conclusions: Compared to the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed method is potentially more consistent in specifying the sparsity profile of human brain activity and is able to produce better source localization for EEG.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1406.2434</p></details> |
| **[Low-Degree Polynomials Extract from Local Sources](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13725v1)** | 2022-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We continue a line of work on extracting random bits from weak sources that are generated by simple processes. We focus on the model of locally samplable sources, where each bit in the source depends on a small number of (hidden) uniformly random input bits. Also known as local sources, this model was introduced by De and Watson (TOCT 2012) and Viola (SICOMP 2014), and is closely related to sources generated by $\mathsf{AC}^0$ circuits and bounded-width branching programs. In particular, extractors for local sources also work for sources generated by these classical computational models. Despite being introduced a decade ago, little progress has been made on improving the entropy requirement for extracting from local sources. The current best explicit extractors require entropy $n^{1/2}$, and follow via a reduction to affine extractors. To start, we prove a barrier showing that one cannot hope to improve this entropy requirement via a black-box reduction of this form. In particular, new techniques are needed. In our main result, we seek to answer whether low-degree polynomials (over $\mathbb{F}_2$) hold potential for breaking this barrier. We answer this question in the positive, and fully characterize the power of low-degree polynomials as extractors for local sources. More precisely, we show that a random degree $r$ polynomial is a low-error extractor for $n$-bit local sources with min-entropy $Ω(r(n\log n)^{1/r})$, and we show that this is tight. Our result leverages several new ingredients, which may be of independent interest. Our existential result relies on a new reduction from local sources to a more structured family, known as local non-oblivious bit-fixing sources. To show its tightness, we prove a "local version" of a structural result by Cohen and Tal (RANDOM 2015), which relies on a new "low-weight" Chevalley-Warning theorem.</p></details> | 44 pages |
| **[Learning to Localize Sound Source in Visual Scenes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03849v1)** | 2019-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual events are usually accompanied by sounds in our daily lives. We pose the question: Can the machine learn the correspondence between visual scene and the sound, and localize the sound source only by observing sound and visual scene pairs like human? In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised algorithm to address the problem of localizing the sound source in visual scenes. A two-stream network structure which handles each modality, with attention mechanism is developed for sound source localization. Moreover, although our network is formulated within the unsupervised learning framework, it can be extended to a unified architecture with a simple modification for the supervised and semi-supervised learning settings as well. Meanwhile, a new sound source dataset is developed for performance evaluation. Our empirical evaluation shows that the unsupervised method eventually go through false conclusion in some cases. We show that even with a few supervision, false conclusion is able to be corrected and the source of sound in a visual scene can be localized effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CVPR 2018.

| **[Learning to Visually Localize Sound Sources from Mixtures without Prior Source Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17420v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of the multi-sound source localization task is to localize sound sources from the mixture individually. While recent multi-sound source localization methods have shown improved performance, they face challenges due to their reliance on prior information about the number of objects to be separated. In this paper, to overcome this limitation, we present a novel multi-sound source localization method that can perform localization without prior knowledge of the number of sound sources. To achieve this goal, we propose an iterative object identification (IOI) module, which can recognize sound-making objects in an iterative manner. After finding the regions of sound-making objects, we devise object similarity-aware clustering (OSC) loss to guide the IOI module to effectively combine regions of the same object but also distinguish between different objects and backgrounds. It enables our method to perform accurate localization of sound-making objects without any prior knowledge. Extensive experimental results on the MUSIC and VGGSound benchmarks show the significant performance improvements of the proposed method over the existing methods for both single and multi-source.

| **[Do We Need Sound for Sound Source Localization?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.05722v1)** | 2020-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the performance of sound source localization which uses both visual and aural information, it presently remains unclear how much either image or sound modalities contribute to the result, i.e. do we need both image and sound for sound source localization? To address this question, we develop an unsupervised learning system that solves sound source localization by decomposing this task into two steps: (i) "potential sound source localization", a step that localizes possible sound sources using only visual information (ii) "object selection", a step that identifies which objects are actually sounding using aural information. Our overall system achieves state-of-the-art performance in sound source localization, and more importantly, we find that despite the constraint on available information, the results of (i) achieve similar performance. From this observation and further experiments, we show that visual information is dominant in "sound" source localization when evaluated with the currently adopted benchmark dataset. Moreover, we show that the majority of sound-producing objects within the samples in this dataset can be inherently identified using only visual information, and thus that the dataset is inadequate to evaluate a system's capability to leverage aural information. As an alternative, we present an evaluation protocol that enforces both visual and aural information to be leveraged, and verify this property through several experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper: 14 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Multiple Sound Sources Localization from Coarse to Fine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.06355v2)** | 2020-07-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to visually localize multiple sound sources in unconstrained videos is a formidable problem, especially when lack of the pairwise sound-object annotations. To solve this problem, we develop a two-stage audiovisual learning framework that disentangles audio and visual representations of different categories from complex scenes, then performs cross-modal feature alignment in a coarse-to-fine manner. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on public dataset of localization, as well as considerable performance on multi-source sound localization in complex scenes. We then employ the localization results for sound separation and obtain comparable performance to existing methods. These outcomes demonstrate our model's ability in effectively aligning sounds with specific visual sources.

| **[Source Localization for Cross Network Information Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14668v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source localization aims to locate information diffusion sources only given the diffusion observation, which has attracted extensive attention in the past few years. Existing methods are mostly tailored for single networks and may not be generalized to handle more complex networks like cross-networks. Cross-network is defined as two interconnected networks, where one network's functionality depends on the other. Source localization on cross-networks entails locating diffusion sources on the source network by only giving the diffused observation in the target network. The task is challenging due to challenges including: 1) diffusion sources distribution modeling; 2) jointly considering both static and dynamic node features; and 3) heterogeneous diffusion patterns learning. In this work, we propose a novel method, namely CNSL, to handle the three primary challenges. Specifically, we propose to learn the distribution of diffusion sources through Bayesian inference and leverage disentangled encoders to separately learn static and dynamic node features. The learning objective is coupled with the cross-network information propagation estimation model to make the inference of diffusion sources considering the overall diffusion process. Additionally, we also provide two novel cross-network datasets collected by ourselves. Extensive experiments are conducted on both datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{CNSL} in handling the source localization on cross-networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data are available at: https://github.com/tanmoysr/CNSL/</p></details> |
| **[Sound Source Localization is All about Cross-Modal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.10724v1)** | 2023-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can easily perceive the direction of sound sources in a visual scene, termed sound source localization. Recent studies on learning-based sound source localization have mainly explored the problem from a localization perspective. However, prior arts and existing benchmarks do not account for a more important aspect of the problem, cross-modal semantic understanding, which is essential for genuine sound source localization. Cross-modal semantic understanding is important in understanding semantically mismatched audio-visual events, e.g., silent objects, or off-screen sounds. To account for this, we propose a cross-modal alignment task as a joint task with sound source localization to better learn the interaction between audio and visual modalities. Thereby, we achieve high localization performance with strong cross-modal semantic understanding. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in both sound source localization and cross-modal retrieval. Our work suggests that jointly tackling both tasks is necessary to conquer genuine sound source localization.</p></details> | ICCV 2023 |

| **[Source Localization in Networks: Trees and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.01814v1)** | 2015-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information diffusion in networks can be used to model many real-world phenomena, including rumor spreading on online social networks, epidemics in human beings, and malware on the Internet. Informally speaking, the source localization problem is to identify a node in the network that provides the best explanation of the observed diffusion. Despite significant efforts and successes over last few years, theoretical guarantees of source localization algorithms were established only for tree networks due to the complexity of the problem. This paper presents a new source localization algorithm, called the Short-Fat Tree (SFT) algorithm. Loosely speaking, the algorithm selects the node such that the breadth-first search (BFS) tree from the node has the minimum depth but the maximum number of leaf nodes. Performance guarantees of SFT under the independent cascade (IC) model are established for both tree networks and the Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graph. On tree networks, SFT is the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimator. On the ER random graph, the following fundamental limits have been obtained: $(i)$ when the infection duration $<\frac{2}{3}t_u,$ SFT identifies the source with probability one asymptotically, where $t_u=\left\lceil\frac{\log n}{\log μ}\right\rceil+2$ and $μ$ is the average node degree, $(ii)$ when the infection duration $>t_u,$ the probability of identifying the source approaches zero asymptotically under any algorithm; and $(iii)$ when infection duration $<t_u,$ the BFS tree starting from the source is a fat tree. Numerical experiments on tree networks, the ER random graphs and real world networks with different evaluation metrics show that the SFT algorithm outperforms existing algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Lastly, new metrics are developed relying on resolution-based multiple source association which enables us to evaluate and compare different localization approaches. We tested our method on both synthetic and real world data.

| **[Acoustic Reflector Localization: Novel Image Source Reversion and Direct Localization Methods](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.05653v2)** | 2017-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acoustic reflector localization is an important issue in audio signal processing, with direct applications in spatial audio, scene reconstruction, and source separation. Several methods have recently been proposed to estimate the 3D positions of acoustic reflectors given room impulse responses (RIRs). In this article, we categorize these methods as "image-source reversion", which localizes the image source before finding the reflector position, and "direct localization", which localizes the reflector without intermediate steps. We present five new contributions. First, an onset detector, called the clustered dynamic programming projected phase-slope algorithm, is proposed to automatically extract the time of arrival for early reflections within the RIRs of a compact microphone array. Second, we propose an image-source reversion method that uses the RIRs from a single loudspeaker. It is constructed by combining an image source locator (the image source direction and range (ISDAR) algorithm), and a reflector locator (using the loudspeaker-image bisection (LIB) algorithm). Third, two variants of it, exploiting multiple loudspeakers, are proposed. Fourth, we present a direct localization method, the ellipsoid tangent sample consensus (ETSAC), exploiting ellipsoid properties to localize the reflector. Finally, systematic experiments on simulated and measured RIRs are presented, comparing the proposed methods with the state-of-the-art. ETSAC generates errors lower than the alternative methods compared through our datasets. Nevertheless, the ISDAR-LIB combination performs well and has a run time 200 times faster than ETSAC.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Locally Decodable Source Coding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.5239v2)** | 2013-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locally decodable channel codes form a special class of error-correcting codes with the property that the decoder is able to reconstruct any bit of the input message from querying only a few bits of a noisy codeword. It is well known that such codes require significantly more redundancy (in particular have vanishing rate) compared to their non-local counterparts. In this paper, we define a dual problem, i.e. locally decodable source codes (LDSC). We consider both almost lossless (block error) and lossy (bit error) cases. In almost lossless case, we show that optimal compression (to entropy) is possible with O(log n) queries to compressed string by the decompressor. We also show the following converse bounds: 1) linear LDSC cannot achieve any rate below one, with a bounded number of queries, 2) rate of any source coding with linear decoder (not necessarily local) in one, 3) for 2 queries, any code construction cannot have a rate below one. In lossy case, we show that any rate above rate distortion is achievable with a bounded number of queries. We also show that, rate distortion is achievable with any scaling number of queries. We provide an achievability bound in the finite block-length regime and compare it with the existing bounds in succinct data structures literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple-Source Ellipsoidal Localization Using Acoustic Energy Measurements](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.07180v1)** | 2019-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, the multiple-source ellipsoidal localization problem based on acoustic energy measurements is investigated via set-membership estimation theory. When the probability density function of measurement noise is unknown-but-bounded, multiple-source localization is a difficult problem since not only the acoustic energy measurements are complicated nonlinear functions of multiple sources, but also the multiple sources bring about a high-dimensional state estimation problem. First, when the energy parameter and the position of the source are bounded in an interval and a ball respectively, the nonlinear remainder bound of the Taylor series expansion is obtained analytically on-line. Next, based on the separability of the nonlinear measurement function, an efficient estimation procedure is developed. It solves the multiple-source localization problem by using an alternating optimization iterative algorithm, in which the remainder bound needs to be known on-line. For this reason, we first derive the remainder bound analytically. When the energy decay factor is unknown but bounded, an efficient estimation procedure is developed based on interval mathematics. Finally, numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the ellipsoidal localization algorithms for multiple-source localization. In particular, our results show that when the noise is non-Gaussian, the set-membership localization algorithm performs better than the EM localization algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 13 figures, submitted to Automatica</p></details> |

The strategies do not require knowledge of the signal propagation models, nor do they exploit the spatial signatures of the source. A non-parametric source localization framework based on a matrix observation model is developed. It is shown that the source location can be estimated by localizing the peaks of a pair of location signature vectors extracted from the incomplete energy observation matrix. A robust peak localization algorithm is developed and shown to decrease the source localization mean squared error (MSE) faster than O(1/M^1.5) with M samples, when there is no measurement noise. To extract the source signature vectors from a matrix with mixed energy from multiple sources, a unimodality-constrained matrix factorization (UMF) problem is formulated, and two rotation techniques are developed to solve the UMF efficiently. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves similar performance as the kernel regression baseline using only 1/5 energy measurement samples in detecting a single source, and the performance gain is more significant in the cases of detecting multiple sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localizing Single and Multiple Oscillatory Sources: A Frequency Divider Approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.00566v1)** | 2024-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localizing sources of troublesome oscillations, particularly forced oscillations (FOs), in power systems has received considerable attention over the last few years. This is driven in part by the massive deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs) that capture these oscillations when they occur; and in part by the increasing incidents of FOs due to malfunctioning components, wind power fluctuations, and/or cyclic loads. Capitalizing on the frequency divider formula of [1], we develop methods to localize single and multiple oscillatory sources using bus frequency measurements. The method to localize a single oscillation source does not require knowledge of network parameters. However, the method for localizing FOs caused by multiple sources requires this knowledge. We explain the reasoning behind this knowledge difference as well as demonstrate the success of our methods for source localization in multiple test systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, to appear in the proceedings of IEEE PESGM 2024</p></details> |

| **[Co-Localization of Audio Sources in Images Using Binaural Features and Locally-Linear Regression](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.2700v4)** | 2016-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of localizing audio sources using binaural measurements. We propose a supervised formulation that simultaneously localizes multiple sources at different locations. The approach is intrinsically efficient because, contrary to prior work, it relies neither on source separation, nor on monaural segregation. The method starts with a training stage that establishes a locally-linear Gaussian regression model between the directional coordinates of all the sources and the auditory features extracted from binaural measurements. While fixed-length wide-spectrum sounds (white noise) are used for training to reliably estimate the model parameters, we show that the testing (localization) can be extended to variable-length sparse-spectrum sounds (such as speech), thus enabling a wide range of realistic applications. Indeed, we demonstrate that the method can be used for audio-visual fusion, namely to map speech signals onto images and hence to spatially align the audio and visual modalities, thus enabling to discriminate between speaking and non-speaking faces. We release a novel corpus of real-room recordings that allow quantitative evaluation of the co-localization method in the presence of one or two sound sources. Experiments demonstrate increased accuracy and speed relative to several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

Our approach exploits the diffraction properties of sound waves as they bend around a barrier or an obstacle in the scene. We combine a ray tracing based sound propagation algorithm with a Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) model, which simulate bending effects by placing a virtual sound source on a wedge in the environment. We precompute the wedges of a reconstructed mesh of an indoor scene and use them to generate diffraction acoustic rays to localize the 3D position of the source. Our method identifies the convergence region of those generated acoustic rays as the estimated source position based on a particle filter. We have evaluated our algorithm in multiple scenarios consisting of a static and dynamic NLOS sound source. In our tested cases, our approach can localize a source position with an average accuracy error, 0.7m, measured by the L2 distance between estimated and actual source locations in a 7m*7m*3m room. Furthermore, we observe 37% to 130% improvement in accuracy over a state-of-the-art localization method that does not model diffraction effects, especially when a sound source is not visible to the robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2019.

| **[Localizing Multiple Radiation Sources Actively with a Particle Filter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.15240v2)** | 2023-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We discuss the localization of radiation sources whose number and other relevant parameters are not known in advance. The data collection is ensured by an autonomous mobile robot that performs a survey in a defined region of interest populated with static obstacles. The measurement trajectory is information-driven rather than pre-planned, and the localization exploits a regularized particle filter estimating the sources' parameters continuously. Regarding the dynamic robot control, this switches between two modes, one attempting to minimize the Shannon entropy and the other aiming to reduce the variance of expected measurements in unexplored parts of the target area; both of the modes maintain safe clearance from the obstacles. The performance of the algorithms was tested in a simulation study based on real-world data acquired previously from three radiation sources exhibiting various activities. Our approach reduces the time necessary to explore the region and to find the sources by approximately 40~\%; at present, however, the method is unable to reliably localize sources that have a relatively low intensity. In this context, additional research has been planned to increase the credibility and robustness of the procedure and to improve the robotic platform autonomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 tables, 3 figures; submitted to Nuclear Engineering and Technology</p></details> |
| **[Global, and Local Optimization Beamforming for Broadband Sources](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04921v4)** | 2023-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an alternative energy function for Global Optimization (GO) beamforming, tailored to acoustic broadband sources. Given, that properties such as the source location, multipole rotation, or flow conditions are parameterized over the frequency, a CSM-fitting can be performed for all frequencies at once. A numerical analysis shows that the nonlinear energy function for the standard GO problem is equivalent to the source's Point Spread Function (PSF) and contains local minima at the grating- and side lobes' locations. The energy function is improved with the proposed broadband energy, as it averages the PSF. Further, it simplifies the process of identifying sources and reconstructing their spectra from the results. The paper shows that the method is superior on synthetic monopoles compared to standard GO and CLEAN-SC. For real-world data the results of the proposed method and CLEAN-SC are similar, and outperform standard GO. The main difference is that source assumption violations cause noisy maps for CLEAN-SC and cause wrong spectral estimations of the proposed method. By using reasonable initial values, the GO problem reduces to a Local Optimization problem with similar results. Further, the proposed method is able to identify synthetic multipoles with different pole amplitudes and unknown pole rotations.</p></details> | Submitted to JASA |
| **[A Two-Step Approach for Narrowband Source Localization in Reverberant Rooms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.13819v1)** | 2023-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a two-step approach for narrowband source localization within reverberant rooms. The first step involves dereverberation by modeling the homogeneous component of the sound field by an equivalent decomposition of planewaves using Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS), while the second step focuses on source localization by modeling the dereverberated component as a sparse representation of point-source distribution using Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP). The proposed method enhances localization accuracy with fewer measurements, particularly in environments with strong reverberation. A numerical simulation in a conference room scenario, using a uniform microphone array affixed to the wall, demonstrates real-world feasibility. Notably, the proposed method and microphone placement effectively localize sound sources within the 2D-horizontal plane without requiring prior knowledge of boundary conditions and room geometry, making it versatile for application in different room types.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semisupervised Clustering by Queries and Locally Encodable Source Coding](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00507v2)** | 2020-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source coding is the canonical problem of data compression in information theory. In a locally encodable source coding, each compressed bit depends on only few bits of the input. In this paper, we show that a recently popular model of semi-supervised clustering is equivalent to locally encodable source coding. In this model, the task is to perform multiclass labeling of unlabeled elements. At the beginning, we can ask in parallel a set of simple queries to an oracle who provides (possibly erroneous) binary answers to the queries. The queries cannot involve more than two (or a fixed constant number of) elements. Now the labeling of all the elements (or clustering) must be performed based on the noisy query answers. The goal is to recover all the correct labelings while minimizing the number of such queries. The equivalence to locally encodable source codes leads us to find lower bounds on the number of queries required in a variety of scenarios. We provide querying schemes based on pairwise `same cluster' queries - and pairwise AND queries and show provable performance guarantees for each of the schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 11 figures.

| **[Symphony: Localizing Multiple Acoustic Sources with a Single Microphone Array](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.15325v1)** | 2022-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound recognition is an important and popular function of smart devices. The location of sound is basic information associated with the acoustic source. Apart from sound recognition, whether the acoustic sources can be localized largely affects the capability and quality of the smart device's interactive functions. In this work, we study the problem of concurrently localizing multiple acoustic sources with a smart device (e.g., a smart speaker like Amazon Alexa). The existing approaches either can only localize a single source, or require deploying a distributed network of microphone arrays to function. Our proposal called Symphony is the first approach to tackle the above problem with a single microphone array. The insight behind Symphony is that the geometric layout of microphones on the array determines the unique relationship among signals from the same source along the same arriving path, while the source's location determines the DoAs (direction-of-arrival) of signals along different arriving paths. Symphony therefore includes a geometry-based filtering module to distinguish signals from different sources along different paths and a coherence-based module to identify signals from the same source. We implement Symphony with different types of commercial off-the-shelf microphone arrays and evaluate its performance under different settings. The results show that Symphony has a median localization error of 0.694m, which is 68% less than that of the state-of-the-art approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Invertible Graph Diffusion Neural Network for Source Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09214v1)** | 2022-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localizing the source of graph diffusion phenomena, such as misinformation propagation, is an important yet extremely challenging task. Existing source localization models typically are heavily dependent on the hand-crafted rules. Unfortunately, a large portion of the graph diffusion process for many applications is still unknown to human beings so it is important to have expressive models for learning such underlying rules automatically. This paper aims to establish a generic framework of invertible graph diffusion models for source localization on graphs, namely Invertible Validity-aware Graph Diffusion (IVGD), to handle major challenges including 1) Difficulty to leverage knowledge in graph diffusion models for modeling their inverse processes in an end-to-end fashion, 2) Difficulty to ensure the validity of the inferred sources, and 3) Efficiency and scalability in source inference. Specifically, first, to inversely infer sources of graph diffusion, we propose a graph residual scenario to make existing graph diffusion models invertible with theoretical guarantees; second, we develop a novel error compensation mechanism that learns to offset the errors of the inferred sources. Finally, to ensure the validity of the inferred sources, a new set of validity-aware layers have been devised to project inferred sources to feasible regions by flexibly encoding constraints with unrolled optimization techniques. A linearization technique is proposed to strengthen the efficiency of our proposed layers. The convergence of the proposed IVGD is proven theoretically. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed IVGD outperforms state-of-the-art comparison methods significantly. We have released our code at https://github.com/xianggebenben/IVGD.</p></details> | WWW 2022 |

| **[Decentralized Source Localization without Sensor Parameters in Wireless Sensor Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01062v3)** | 2020-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the source (event) localization problem in decentralized wireless sensor networks (WSNs) under the fault model without knowing the sensor parameters. Event localizations have many applications such as localizing intruders, Wifi hotspots and users, and faults in power systems. Previous studies assume the true knowledge (or good estimates) of sensor parameters (e.g., fault model probability or Region of Influence (ROI) of the source) for source localization. However, we propose two methods to estimate the source location in this paper under the fault model: hitting set approach and feature selection method, which only utilize the noisy data set at the fusion center for estimation of the source location without knowing the sensor parameters. The proposed methods have been shown to localize the source effectively. We also study the lower bound on the sample complexity requirement for hitting set method. These methods have also been extended for multiple sources localizations. In addition, we modify the proposed feature selection approach to use maximum likelihood. Finally, extensive simulations are carried out for different settings (i.e., the number of sensor nodes and sample complexity) to validate our proposed methods in comparison to centroid, maximum likelihood, FTML, SNAP estimators.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[T-VSL: Text-Guided Visual Sound Source Localization in Mixtures](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.01751v2)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual sound source localization poses a significant challenge in identifying the semantic region of each sounding source within a video. Existing self-supervised and weakly supervised source localization methods struggle to accurately distinguish the semantic regions of each sounding object, particularly in multi-source mixtures. These methods often rely on audio-visual correspondence as guidance, which can lead to substantial performance drops in complex multi-source localization scenarios. The lack of access to individual source sounds in multi-source mixtures during training exacerbates the difficulty of learning effective audio-visual correspondence for localization. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose incorporating the text modality as an intermediate feature guide using tri-modal joint embedding models (e.g., AudioCLIP) to disentangle the semantic audio-visual source correspondence in multi-source mixtures. Our framework, dubbed T-VSL, begins by predicting the class of sounding entities in mixtures. Subsequently, the textual representation of each sounding source is employed as guidance to disentangle fine-grained audio-visual source correspondence from multi-source mixtures, leveraging the tri-modal AudioCLIP embedding. This approach enables our framework to handle a flexible number of sources and exhibits promising zero-shot transferability to unseen classes during test time. Extensive experiments conducted on the MUSIC, VGGSound, and VGGSound-Instruments datasets demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

In the blind setting, in which the source signals are not known, the localization task is challenging due to the data association problem. That is, it is not known which of the TDOA measurements correspond to the same source. Herein, we propose to perform joint localization and data association by means of an optimal transport formulation. The method operates by finding optimal groupings of TDOA measurements and associating these with candidate source locations. To allow for computationally feasible localization in three-dimensional space, an efficient set of candidate locations is constructed using a minimal multilateration solver based on minimal sets of receiver pairs. In numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method is robust both to measurement noise and TDOA detection errors. Furthermore, it is shown that the data association provided by the proposed method allows for statistically efficient estimates of the source locations.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the localization of sources of broadband acoustic radiated noise (such as motor vessels) in shallow water multipath environments. It is shown that CNNs operating on cepstrogram and generalized cross-correlogram inputs are able to more reliably estimate the instantaneous range and bearing of transiting motor vessels when the source localization performance of conventional passive ranging methods is degraded. The ensuing improvement in source localization performance is demonstrated using real data collected during an at-sea experiment.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, Final draft of paper submitted to 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) 15-20 April 2018 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1612.03505</p></details> |
| **[Indoor Sound Source Localization with Probabilistic Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07814v1)** | 2018-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is known that adverse environments such as high reverberation and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) pose a great challenge to indoor sound source localization. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a sound source localization algorithm based on probabilistic neural network, namely Generalized cross correlation Classification Algorithm (GCA). Experimental results for adverse environments with high reverberation time T60 up to 600ms and low SNR such as -10dB show that, the average azimuth angle error and elevation angle error by GCA are only 4.6 degrees and 3.1 degrees respectively. Compared with three recently published algorithms, GCA has increased the success rate on direction of arrival estimation significantly with good robustness to environmental changes. These results show that the proposed GCA can localize accurately and robustly for diverse indoor applications where the site acoustic features can be studied prior to the localization stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics</p></details> |
| **[Current Source Localization Using Deep Prior with Depth Weighting](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.13981v1)** | 2022-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a novel neuronal current source localization method based on Deep Prior that represents a more complicated prior distribution of current source using convolutional networks. Deep Prior has been suggested as a means of an unsupervised learning approach that does not require learning using training data, and randomly-initialized neural networks are used to update a source location using a single observation. In our previous work, a Deep-Prior-based current source localization method in the brain has been proposed but the performance was not almost the same as those of conventional approaches, such as sLORETA. In order to improve the Deep-Prior-based approach, in this paper, a depth weight of the current source is introduced for Deep Prior, where depth weighting amounts to assigning more penalty to the superficial currents. Its effectiveness is confirmed by experiments of current source estimation on simulated MEG data.</p></details> |  |

Our approach is flexible in the sense that a single model can be used with an arbitrary number of microphones, even when a subset of audio recordings and microphone coordinates are missing. We test our method on simulated and real-world recordings of music and speech in indoor environments, and demonstrate competitive performance compared to both classical and other learning based localization methods.</p></details> | IPIN 2024 |
| **[High Precision TOA-based Direct Localization of Multiple Sources in Multipath](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.03193v1)** | 2015-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localization of radio frequency sources over multipath channels is a difficult problem arising in applications such as outdoor or indoor gelocation. Common approaches that combine ad-hoc methods for multipath mitigation with indirect localization relying on intermediary parameters such as time-of-arrivals, time difference of arrivals or received signal strengths, provide limited performance. This work models the localization of known waveforms over unknown multipath channels in a sparse framework, and develops a direct approach in which multiple sources are localized jointly, directly from observations obtained at distributed sources. The proposed approach exploits channel properties that enable to distinguish line-of-sight (LOS) from non-LOS signal paths. Theoretical guarantees are established for correct recovery of the sources' locations by atomic norm minimization. A second-order cone-based algorithm is developed to produce the optimal atomic decomposition, and it is shown to produce high accuracy location estimates over complex scenes, in which sources are subject to diverse multipath conditions, including lack of LOS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Sound Source Localization considering Similarity of Back-Propagation Signals](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.09179v1)** | 2019-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel, robust sound source localization algorithm considering back-propagation signals. Sound propagation paths are estimated by generating direct and reflection acoustic rays based on ray tracing in a backward manner. We then compute the back-propagation signals by designing and using the impulse response of the backward sound propagation based on the acoustic ray paths. For identifying the 3D source position, we suggest a localization method based on the Monte Carlo localization algorithm. Candidates for a source position is determined by identifying the convergence regions of acoustic ray paths. This candidate is validated by measuring similarities between back-propagation signals, under the assumption that the back-propagation signals of different acoustic ray paths should be similar near the sound source position. Thanks to considering similarities of back-propagation signals, our approach can localize a source position with an averaged error of 0.51 m in a room of 7 m by 7 m area with 3 m height in tested environments. We also observe 65 % to 220 % improvement in accuracy over the stateof-the-art method. This improvement is achieved in environments containing a moving source, an obstacle, and noises.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a Bayesian estimation method that can localize an unknown number of static sources in 3-D based on TDOA measurements. The proposed localization algorithm based on particle flow (PFL) can overcome the challenges related to the highly nonlinear TDOA measurement model, the data association (DA) uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the number of sources to be localized. Different PFL strategies are compared within a unified belief propagation (BP) framework in a challenging multisensor source localization problem. In particular, we consider PFL-based approximation of beliefs based on one or multiple Gaussian kernels with parameters computed using deterministic and stochastic flow processes. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can correctly determine the number of sources and provide accurate location estimates. The stochastic flow demonstrates greater accuracy compared to the deterministic flow when using the same number of particles.</p></details> | 8 pages |

In this work, we introduce the first application of graph-based learning for jamming source localization, addressing the imminent threat of jamming attacks in wireless networks. Unlike geometric optimization techniques that struggle under environmental uncertainties and dense interference, we reformulate the localization as an inductive graph regression task. Our approach integrates structured node representations that encode local and global signal aggregation, ensuring spatial coherence and adaptive signal fusion. To enhance robustness, we incorporate an attention-based \ac{GNN} that adaptively refines neighborhood influence and introduces a confidence-guided estimation mechanism that dynamically balances learned predictions with domain-informed priors. We evaluate our approach under complex \ac{RF} environments with various sampling densities, network topologies, jammer characteristics, and signal propagation conditions, conducting comprehensive ablation studies on graph construction, feature selection, and pooling strategies. Results demonstrate that our novel graph-based learning framework significantly outperforms established localization baselines, particularly in challenging scenarios with sparse and obfuscated signal information.

| **[A Closer Look at Weakly-Supervised Audio-Visual Source Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09634v1)** | 2022-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-visual source localization is a challenging task that aims to predict the location of visual sound sources in a video. Since collecting ground-truth annotations of sounding objects can be costly, a plethora of weakly-supervised localization methods that can learn from datasets with no bounding-box annotations have been proposed in recent years, by leveraging the natural co-occurrence of audio and visual signals. Despite significant interest, popular evaluation protocols have two major flaws. First, they allow for the use of a fully annotated dataset to perform early stopping, thus significantly increasing the annotation effort required for training. Second, current evaluation metrics assume the presence of sound sources at all times. This is of course an unrealistic assumption, and thus better metrics are necessary to capture the model's performance on (negative) samples with no visible sound sources. To accomplish this, we extend the test set of popular benchmarks, Flickr SoundNet and VGG-Sound Sources, in order to include negative samples, and measure performance using metrics that balance localization accuracy and recall. Using the new protocol, we conducted an extensive evaluation of prior methods, and found that most prior works are not capable of identifying negatives and suffer from significant overfitting problems (rely heavily on early stopping for best results). We also propose a new approach for visual sound source localization that addresses both these problems. In particular, we found that, through extreme visual dropout and the use of momentum encoders, the proposed approach combats overfitting effectively, and establishes a new state-of-the-art performance on both Flickr SoundNet and VGG-Sound Source. Code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/stoneMo/SLAVC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Localization of an Arbitrary Distribution of Radioactive Sources for Aerial Inspection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.01701v3)** | 2018-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiation source detection has seen various applications in the past decade, ranging from the detection of dirty bombs in public places to scanning critical nuclear facilities for leakage or flaws, and in the autonomous inspection of nuclear sites. Despite the success in detecting single point sources or a small number of spatially separated point sources, most of the existing algorithms fail to localize sources in complex scenarios with a large number of point sources or non-trivial distributions & bulk sources. Even in simpler environments, most existing algorithms are not scalable to larger regions and/or higher dimensional spaces. For effective autonomous inspection, we not only need to estimate the positions of the sources, but also the number, distribution, and intensities of each of them. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for the robust localization of an arbitrary distribution of radiation sources using multi-layer sequential Monte Carlo methods coupled with suitable clustering algorithms. We achieve near-perfect accuracy, in terms of F1-scores (> 0.95), while allowing the algorithm to scale, both to large regions in space and to higher dimensional spaces (5 tested).</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 10 figures.

The proposed approach uses a Physics-Guided Neural Network to approximate the gas dispersion with the source location as an additional network input. After an initial offline training phase, the neural network can be used to efficiently solve the inverse problem of localizing the gas source based on measurements. The proposed approach allows avoiding rather costly numerical simulations of gas physics needed for solving inverse problems. Our experiments show that the method localizes the source well, even when dealing with measurements affected by noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submission to the International Symposium of Electronic Nose (ISOEN)</p></details> |

Existing work in this area focuses on creating attention maps to capture the correlation between the two modalities to localize the source of the sound. In a video, oftentimes, the objects exhibiting movement are the ones generating the sound. In this work, we capture this characteristic by modeling the optical flow in a video as a prior to better aid in localizing the sound source. We further demonstrate that the addition of flow-based attention substantially improves visual sound source localization. Finally, we benchmark our method on standard sound source localization datasets and achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Soundnet Flickr and VGG Sound Source datasets.

Despite many numerical methods existed for EEG source localization, they all rely on strong priors and the deep sources are intractable. Here we propose a deep learning framework using spatial basis function decomposition for EEG source localization. This framework combines the edge sparsity prior and Gaussian source basis, called Edge Sparse Basis Network (ESBN). The performance of ESBN is validated by both synthetic data and real EEG data during motor tasks. The results suggest that the supervised ESBN outperforms the traditional numerical methods in synthetic data and the unsupervised fine-tuning provides more focal and accurate localizations in real data. Our proposed deep learning framework can be extended to account for other source priors, and the real-time property of ESBN can facilitate the applications of EEG in brain-computer interfaces and clinics.</p></details> |  |

| **[Source-Free Object Detection with Detection Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11090v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting (OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks, enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion; and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Alignment for Source Free Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.04265v1)** | 2023-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-free object detection (SFOD) aims to transfer a detector pre-trained on a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain without seeing source data. While most existing SFOD methods generate pseudo labels via a source-pretrained model to guide training, these pseudo labels usually contain high noises due to heavy domain discrepancy. In order to obtain better pseudo supervisions, we divide the target domain into source-similar and source-dissimilar parts and align them in the feature space by adversarial learning. Specifically, we design a detection variance-based criterion to divide the target domain. This criterion is motivated by a finding that larger detection variances denote higher recall and larger similarity to the source domain. Then we incorporate an adversarial module into a mean teacher framework to drive the feature spaces of these two subsets indistinguishable. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain object detection datasets demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms the compared SFOD methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gun Source and Muzzle Head Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11120v1)** | 2021-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a surging need across the world for protection against gun violence. There are three main areas that we have identified as challenging in research that tries to curb gun violence: temporal location of gunshots, gun type prediction and gun source (shooter) detection. Our task is gun source detection and muzzle head detection, where the muzzle head is the round opening of the firing end of the gun. We would like to locate the muzzle head of the gun in the video visually, and identify who has fired the shot. In our formulation, we turn the problem of muzzle head detection into two sub-problems of human object detection and gun smoke detection. Our assumption is that the muzzle head typically lies between the gun smoke caused by the shot and the shooter. We have interesting results both in bounding the shooter as well as detecting the gun smoke. In our experiments, we are successful in detecting the muzzle head by detecting the gun smoke and the shooter.</p></details> | EI 2020 |
| **[Malicious Source Code Detection Using Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.07957v1)** | 2022-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open source code is considered a common practice in modern software development. However, reusing other code allows bad actors to access a wide developers' community, hence the products that rely on it. Those attacks are categorized as supply chain attacks. Recent years saw a growing number of supply chain attacks that leverage open source during software development, relaying the download and installation procedures, whether automatic or manual. Over the years, many approaches have been invented for detecting vulnerable packages. However, it is uncommon to detect malicious code within packages. Those detection approaches can be broadly categorized as analyzes that use (dynamic) and do not use (static) code execution. Here, we introduce Malicious Source code Detection using Transformers (MSDT) algorithm. MSDT is a novel static analysis based on a deep learning method that detects real-world code injection cases to source code packages. In this study, we used MSDT and a dataset with over 600,000 different functions to embed various functions and applied a clustering algorithm to the resulting vectors, detecting the malicious functions by detecting the outliers. We evaluated MSDT's performance by conducting extensive experiments and demonstrated that our algorithm is capable of detecting functions that were injected with malicious code with precision@k values of up to 0.909.</p></details> |  |
| **[Social Diffusion Sources Can Escape Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10539v2)** | 2022-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influencing (and being influenced by) others through social networks is fundamental to all human societies. Whether this happens through the diffusion of rumors, opinions, or viruses, identifying the diffusion source (i.e., the person that initiated it) is a problem that has attracted much research interest. Nevertheless, existing literature has ignored the possibility that the source might strategically modify the network structure (by rewiring links or introducing fake nodes) to escape detection. Here, without restricting our analysis to any particular diffusion scenario, we close this gap by evaluating two mechanisms that hide the source-one stemming from the source's actions, the other from the network structure itself. This reveals that sources can easily escape detection, and that removing links is far more effective than introducing fake nodes. Thus, efforts should focus on exposing concealed ties rather than planted entities; such exposure would drastically improve our chances of detecting the diffusion source.</p></details> | <details><summary>100 p...</summary><p>100 pages, 80 figures</p></details> |
| **[SFUOD: Source-Free Unknown Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17373v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-free object detection adapts a detector pre-trained on a source domain to an unlabeled target domain without requiring access to labeled source data. While this setting is practical as it eliminates the need for the source dataset during domain adaptation, it operates under the restrictive assumption that only pre-defined objects from the source domain exist in the target domain. This closed-set setting prevents the detector from detecting undefined objects. To ease this assumption, we propose Source-Free Unknown Object Detection (SFUOD), a novel scenario which enables the detector to not only recognize known objects but also detect undefined objects as unknown objects. To this end, we propose CollaPAUL (Collaborative tuning and Principal Axis-based Unknown Labeling), a novel framework for SFUOD. Collaborative tuning enhances knowledge adaptation by integrating target-dependent knowledge from the auxiliary encoder with source-dependent knowledge from the pre-trained detector through a cross-domain attention mechanism. Additionally, principal axes-based unknown labeling assigns pseudo-labels to unknown objects by estimating objectness via principal axes projection and confidence scores from model predictions. The proposed CollaPAUL achieves state-of-the-art performances on SFUOD benchmarks, and extensive experiments validate its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Conformal Prediction for Multi-Source Detection on a Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08867v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting the origin of information or infection spread in networks is a fundamental challenge with applications in misinformation tracking, epidemiology, and beyond. We study the multi-source detection problem: given snapshot observations of node infection status on a graph, estimate the set of source nodes that initiated the propagation. Existing methods either lack statistical guarantees or are limited to specific diffusion models and assumptions. We propose a novel conformal prediction framework that provides statistically valid recall guarantees for source set detection, independent of the underlying diffusion process or data distribution. Our approach introduces principled score functions to quantify the alignment between predicted probabilities and true sources, and leverages a calibration set to construct prediction sets with user-specified recall and coverage levels. The method is applicable to both single- and multi-source scenarios, supports general network diffusion dynamics, and is computationally efficient for large graphs. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves rigorous coverage with competitive accuracy, outperforming existing baselines in both reliability and scalability.The code is available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Academic Source Code Plagiarism Detection by Measuring Program Behavioural Similarity](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03995v1)** | 2021-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source code plagiarism is a long-standing issue in tertiary computer science education. Many source code plagiarism detection tools have been proposed to aid in the detection of source code plagiarism. However, existing detection tools are not robust to pervasive plagiarism-hiding transformations, and as a result can be inaccurate in the detection of plagiarised source code. This article presents BPlag, a behavioural approach to source code plagiarism detection. BPlag is designed to be both robust to pervasive plagiarism-hiding transformations, and accurate in the detection of plagiarised source code. Greater robustness and accuracy is afforded by analysing the behaviour of a program, as behaviour is perceived to be the least susceptible aspect of a program impacted upon by plagiarism-hiding transformations. BPlag applies symbolic execution to analyse execution behaviour and represent a program in a novel graph-based format. Plagiarism is then detected by comparing these graphs and evaluating similarity scores. BPlag is evaluated for robustness, accuracy and efficiency against 5 commonly used source code plagiarism detection tools. It is then shown that BPlag is more robust to plagiarism-hiding transformations and more accurate in the detection of plagiarised source code, but is less efficient than compared tools.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Vulnerability Detection in Open Source Software: An Introduction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16428v1)** | 2022-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is an introductory discussion on the cause of open source software vulnerabilities, their importance in the cybersecurity ecosystem, and a selection of detection methods. A recent application security report showed 44% of applications contain critical vulnerabilities in an open source component, a concerning proportion. Most companies do not have a reliable way of being directly and promptly notified when zero-day vulnerabilities are found and then when patches are made available. This means attack vectors in open source exist longer than necessary. Conventional approaches to vulnerability detection are outlined alongside some newer research trends. A conclusion is made that it may not be possible to entirely replace expert human inspection of open source software, although it can be effectively augmented with techniques such as machine learning, IDE plug-ins and repository linking to make implementation and review less time intensive. Underpinning any technological advances should be better knowledge at the human level. Development teams need trained, coached and improved so they can implement open source more securely, know what vulnerabilities to look for and how to handle them. It is the use of this blended approach to detection which is key.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version dated March 26th 2017</p></details> |
| **[Detection of Rumors and Their Sources in Social Networks: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05292v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent advancements in social network platform technology, an overwhelming amount of information is spreading rapidly. In this situation, it can become increasingly difficult to discern what information is false or true. If false information proliferates significantly, it can lead to undesirable outcomes. Hence, when we receive some information, we can pose the following two questions: $(i)$ Is the information true? $(ii)$ If not, who initially spread that information? % The first problem is the rumor detection issue, while the second is the rumor source detection problem. A rumor-detection problem involves identifying and mitigating false or misleading information spread via various communication channels, particularly online platforms and social media. Rumors can range from harmless ones to deliberately misleading content aimed at deceiving or manipulating audiences. Detecting misinformation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of information ecosystems and preventing harmful effects such as the spread of false beliefs, polarization, and even societal harm. Therefore, it is very important to quickly distinguish such misinformation while simultaneously finding its source to block it from spreading on the network. However, most of the existing surveys have analyzed these two issues separately. In this work, we first survey the existing research on the rumor-detection and rumor source detection problems with joint detection approaches, simultaneously. % This survey deals with these two issues together so that their relationship can be observed and it provides how the two problems are similar and different. The limitations arising from the rumor detection, rumor source detection, and their combination problems are also explained, and some challenges to be addressed in future works are presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rumor Source Detection under Querying with Untruthful Answers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05496v5)** | 2020-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social networks are the major routes for most individuals to exchange their opinions about new products, social trends and political issues via their interactions. It is often of significant importance to figure out who initially diffuses the information, ie, finding a rumor source or a trend setter. It is known that such a task is highly challenging and the source detection probability cannot be beyond 31 percent for regular trees, if we just estimate the source from a given diffusion snapshot. In practice, finding the source often entails the process of querying that asks "Are you the rumor source?" or "Who tells you the rumor?" that would increase the chance of detecting the source. In this paper, we consider two kinds of querying: (a) simple batch querying and (b) interactive querying with direction under the assumption that queries can be untruthful with some probability. We propose estimation algorithms for those queries, and quantify their detection performance and the amount of extra budget due to untruthfulness, analytically showing that querying significantly improves the detection performance. We perform extensive simulations to validate our theoretical findings over synthetic and real-world social network topologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing the Power of LLMs in Source Code Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03489v1)** | 2024-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities, caused by unintentional flaws in source code, are a primary root cause of cyberattacks. Static analysis of source code has been widely used to detect these unintentional defects introduced by software developers. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated human-like conversational abilities due to their capacity to capture complex patterns in sequential data, such as natural languages. In this paper, we harness LLMs' capabilities to analyze source code and detect known vulnerabilities. To ensure the proposed vulnerability detection method is universal across multiple programming languages, we convert source code to LLVM IR and train LLMs on these intermediate representations. We conduct extensive experiments on various LLM architectures and compare their accuracy. Our comprehensive experiments on real-world and synthetic codes from NVD and SARD demonstrate high accuracy in identifying source code vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis and Detection of Pathological Voice using Glottal Source Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14080v2)** | 2023-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic detection of voice pathology enables objective assessment and earlier intervention for the diagnosis. This study provides a systematic analysis of glottal source features and investigates their effectiveness in voice pathology detection. Glottal source features are extracted using glottal flows estimated with the quasi-closed phase (QCP) glottal inverse filtering method, using approximate glottal source signals computed with the zero frequency filtering (ZFF) method, and using acoustic voice signals directly. In addition, we propose to derive mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) from the glottal source waveforms computed by QCP and ZFF to effectively capture the variations in glottal source spectra of pathological voice. Experiments were carried out using two databases, the Hospital Universitario Principe de Asturias (HUPA) database and the Saarbrucken Voice Disorders (SVD) database. Analysis of features revealed that the glottal source contains information that discriminates normal and pathological voice. Pathology detection experiments were carried out using support vector machine (SVM). From the detection experiments it was observed that the performance achieved with the studied glottal source features is comparable or better than that of conventional MFCCs and perceptual linear prediction (PLP) features. The best detection performance was achieved when the glottal source features were combined with the conventional MFCCs and PLP features, which indicates the complementary nature of the features.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2020 IEEE.

| **[3D Detection and Characterisation of ALMA Sources through Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.11462v1)** | 2022-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a Deep-Learning (DL) pipeline developed for the detection and characterization of astronomical sources within simulated Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) data cubes. The pipeline is composed of six DL models: a Convolutional Autoencoder for source detection within the spatial domain of the integrated data cubes, a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for denoising and peak detection within the frequency domain, and four Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) for source characterization. The combination of spatial and frequency information improves completeness while decreasing spurious signal detection. To train and test the pipeline, we developed a simulation algorithm able to generate realistic ALMA observations, i.e. both sky model and dirty cubes. The algorithm simulates always a central source surrounded by fainter ones scattered within the cube. Some sources were spatially superimposed in order to test the pipeline deblending capabilities. The detection performances of the pipeline were compared to those of other methods and significant improvements in performances were achieved. Source morphologies are detected with subpixel accuracies obtaining mean residual errors of $10^{-3}$ pixel ($0.1$ mas) and $10^{-1}$ mJy/beam on positions and flux estimations, respectively. Projection angles and flux densities are also recovered within $10\%$ of the true values for $80\%$ and $73\%$ of all sources in the test set, respectively. While our pipeline is fine-tuned for ALMA data, the technique is applicable to other interferometric observatories, as SKA, LOFAR, VLBI, and VLTI.</p></details> |  |

Our approach is based on an encoder-decoder neural network architecture that uses a low number of convolutional layers to provide a scalable solution for source detection. In addition, DECORAS performs source characterization in terms of the position, effective radius and peak brightness of the detected sources. We have trained and tested the network with images that are based on realistic Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 20 cm. Also, these images have not gone through any prior de-convolution step and are directly related to the visibility data via a Fourier transform. We find that the source catalog generated by DECORAS has a better overall completeness and purity, when compared to a traditional source detection algorithm. DECORAS is complete at the 7.5$σ$ level, and has an almost factor of two improvement in reliability at 5.5$σ$. We find that DECORAS can recover the position of the detected sources to within 0.61 $\pm$ 0.69 mas, and the effective radius and peak surface brightness are recovered to within 20 per cent for 98 and 94 per cent of the sources, respectively. Overall, we find that DECORAS provides a reliable source detection and characterization solution for future wide-field VLBI surveys.</p></details> | submitted to MNRAS |

Existing Chinese fake news detection datasets are limited to news sourced solely from Weibo. However, fake news originating from multiple sources exhibits diversity in various aspects, including its content and social context. Methods trained on purely one single news source can hardly be applicable to real-world scenarios. Our pilot experiment demonstrates that the F1 score of the state-of-the-art method that learns from a large Chinese fake news detection dataset, Weibo-21, drops significantly from 0.943 to 0.470 when the test data is changed to multi-source news data, failing to identify more than one-third of the multi-source fake news. To address this limitation, we constructed the first multi-source benchmark dataset for Chinese fake news detection, termed MCFEND, which is composed of news we collected from diverse sources such as social platforms, messaging apps, and traditional online news outlets. Notably, such news has been fact-checked by 14 authoritative fact-checking agencies worldwide. In addition, various existing Chinese fake news detection methods are thoroughly evaluated on our proposed dataset in cross-source, multi-source, and unseen source ways. MCFEND, as a benchmark dataset, aims to advance Chinese fake news detection approaches in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Web Conference 2024 (WWW 2024) oral, dataset available: https://github.com/TrustworthyComp</p></details> |
| **[DeepSource: Point Source Detection using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.02701v1)** | 2019-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point source detection at low signal-to-noise is challenging for astronomical surveys, particularly in radio interferometry images where the noise is correlated. Machine learning is a promising solution, allowing the development of algorithms tailored to specific telescope arrays and science cases. We present DeepSource - a deep learning solution - that uses convolutional neural networks to achieve these goals. DeepSource enhances the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of the original map and then uses dynamic blob detection to detect sources. Trained and tested on two sets of 500 simulated 1 deg x 1 deg MeerKAT images with a total of 300,000 sources, DeepSource is essentially perfect in both purity and completeness down to SNR = 4 and outperforms PyBDSF in all metrics. For uniformly-weighted images it achieves a Purity x Completeness (PC) score at SNR = 3 of 0.73, compared to 0.31 for the best PyBDSF model. For natural-weighting we find a smaller improvement of ~40% in the PC score at SNR = 3. If instead we ask where either of the purity or completeness first drop to 90%, we find that DeepSource reaches this value at SNR = 3.6 compared to the 4.3 of PyBDSF (natural-weighting). A key advantage of DeepSource is that it can learn to optimally trade off purity and completeness for any science case under consideration. Our results show that deep learning is a promising approach to point source detection in astronomical images.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures, submitted to MNRAS</p></details> |

This paper proposes the Point Proposal Network (PPN): a point source detector that utilises deep convolutional neural networks for fast source detection.

Three evaluation mechanisms that directly relate human perspective with evaluated approaches are proposed: think-aloud, aspect-oriented, and empirical mechanism. Using those mechanisms, a comparative study toward attribute-and structure-based plagiarism detection approach (i.e., two popular approach categories in source code plagiarism detection) is conducted. According to that study, structure-based approach is more effective than the attribute-based one; its signature aspect and resulted similarity degrees are more related to human preferences. In addition, such approach is related to most human-oriented aspects for suspecting source code plagiarism.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 9...</summary><p>The 9th International Conference on Awareness Science and Technology</p></details> |
| **[Multi-source weak supervision for saliency detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.00566v1)** | 2019-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high cost of pixel-level annotations makes it appealing to train saliency detection models with weak supervision. However, a single weak supervision source usually does not contain enough information to train a well-performing model. To this end, we propose a unified framework to train saliency detection models with diverse weak supervision sources. In this paper, we use category labels, captions, and unlabelled data for training, yet other supervision sources can also be plugged into this flexible framework. We design a classification network (CNet) and a caption generation network (PNet), which learn to predict object categories and generate captions, respectively, meanwhile highlight the most important regions for corresponding tasks. An attention transfer loss is designed to transmit supervision signal between networks, such that the network designed to be trained with one supervision source can benefit from another. An attention coherence loss is defined on unlabelled data to encourage the networks to detect generally salient regions instead of task-specific regions. We use CNet and PNet to generate pixel-level pseudo labels to train a saliency prediction network (SNet). During the testing phases, we only need SNet to predict saliency maps. Experiments demonstrate the performance of our method compares favourably against unsupervised and weakly supervised methods and even some supervised methods.</p></details> | cvpr2019 |
| **[Straight to the Source: Detecting Aggregate Objects in Astronomical Images with Proper Error Control](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0910.5449v1)** | 2009-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The next generation of telescopes will acquire terabytes of image data on a nightly basis. Collectively, these large images will contain billions of interesting objects, which astronomers call sources. The astronomers' task is to construct a catalog detailing the coordinates and other properties of the sources. The source catalog is the primary data product for most telescopes and is an important input for testing new astrophysical theories, but to construct the catalog one must first detect the sources. Existing algorithms for catalog creation are effective at detecting sources, but do not have rigorous statistical error control. At the same time, there are several multiple testing procedures that provide rigorous error control, but they are not designed to detect sources that are aggregated over several pixels. In this paper, we propose a technique that does both, by providing rigorous statistical error control on the aggregate objects themselves rather than the pixels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory Satellite. Our technique effectively controls the rate of false sources, yet still detects almost all of the sources detected by procedures that do not have such rigorous error control and have the advantage of additional data in the form of follow up observations, which will not be available for upcoming large telescopes. In fact, we even detect a new source that was missed by previous studies. The statistical methods developed in this paper can be extended to problems beyond Astronomy, as we will illustrate with an example from Neuroimaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Source Domain Adaptation for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.15793v1)** | 2021-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To reduce annotation labor associated with object detection, an increasing number of studies focus on transferring the learned knowledge from a labeled source domain to another unlabeled target domain. However, existing methods assume that the labeled data are sampled from a single source domain, which ignores a more generalized scenario, where labeled data are from multiple source domains. For the more challenging task, we propose a unified Faster R-CNN based framework, termed Divide-and-Merge Spindle Network (DMSN), which can simultaneously enhance domain invariance and preserve discriminative power. Specifically, the framework contains multiple source subnets and a pseudo target subnet. First, we propose a hierarchical feature alignment strategy to conduct strong and weak alignments for low- and high-level features, respectively, considering their different effects for object detection. Second, we develop a novel pseudo subnet learning algorithm to approximate optimal parameters of pseudo target subset by weighted combination of parameters in different source subnets. Finally, a consistency regularization for region proposal network is proposed to facilitate each subnet to learn more abstract invariances. Extensive experiments on different adaptation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model.</p></details> |  |

The lack of a benchmark for mixed-source misinformation has hindered progress in this field. To address this, we introduce MMFakeBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for mixed-source MMD. MMFakeBench includes 3 critical sources: textual veracity distortion, visual veracity distortion, and cross-modal consistency distortion, along with 12 sub-categories of misinformation forgery types. We further conduct an extensive evaluation of 6 prevalent detection methods and 15 Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) on MMFakeBench under a zero-shot setting. The results indicate that current methods struggle under this challenging and realistic mixed-source MMD setting. Additionally, we propose MMD-Agent, a novel approach to integrate the reasoning, action, and tool-use capabilities of LVLM agents, significantly enhancing accuracy and generalization. We believe this study will catalyze future research into more realistic mixed-source multimodal misinformation and provide a fair evaluation of misinformation detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, Project page: https://liuxuannan.github.io/MMFakeBench.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Source Detection via Contact Tracing in the Presence of Asymptomatic Patients](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.14530v1)** | 2021-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring the source of a diffusion in a large network of agents is a difficult but feasible task, if a few agents act as sensors revealing the time at which they got hit by the diffusion. A main limitation of current source detection algorithms is that they assume full knowledge of the contact network, which is rarely the case, especially for epidemics, where the source is called patient zero. Inspired by recent contact tracing algorithms, we propose a new framework, which we call Source Detection via Contact Tracing Framework (SDCTF). In the SDCTF, the source detection task starts at the time of the first hospitalization, and initially we have no knowledge about the contact network other than the identity of the first hospitalized agent. We may then explore the network by contact queries, and obtain symptom onset times by test queries in an adaptive way. We also assume that some of the agents may be asymptomatic, and therefore cannot reveal their symptom onset time. Our goal is to find patient zero with as few contact and test queries as possible. We propose two local search algorithms for the SDCTF: the LS algorithm is more data-efficient, but can fail to find the true source if many asymptomatic agents are present, whereas the LS+ algorithm is more robust to asymptomatic agents. By simulations we show that both LS and LS+ outperform state of the art adaptive and non-adaptive source detection algorithms adapted to the SDCTF, even though these baseline algorithms have full access to the contact network. Extending the theory of random exponential trees, we analytically approximate the probability of success of the LS/ LS+ algorithms, and we show that our analytic results match the simulations. Finally, we benchmark our algorithms on the Data-driven COVID-19 Simulator developed by Lorch et al., which is the first time source detection algorithms are tested on such a complex dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source Detection in Networks using the Stationary Distribution of a Markov Chain](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.11330v1)** | 2024-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, the diffusion of information through social networks is a powerful phenomenon. One common way to model diffusions in social networks is the Independent Cascade (IC) model. Given a set of infected nodes according to the IC model, a natural problem is the source detection problem, in which the goal is to identify the unique node that has started the diffusion. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is a common approach for tackling the source detection problem, but it is computationally hard. In this work, we propose an efficient method for the source detection problem under the MLE approach, which is based on computing the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. Using simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to other state-of-the-art methods from the literature, both on random and real-world networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the robustness of source code plagiarism detection tools to pervasive plagiarism-hiding modifications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.03997v1)** | 2021-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source code plagiarism is a common occurrence in undergraduate computer science education. In order to identify such cases, many source code plagiarism detection tools have been proposed. A source code plagiarism detection tool evaluates pairs of assignment submissions to detect indications of plagiarism. However, a plagiarising student will commonly apply plagiarism-hiding modifications to source code in an attempt to evade detection. Subsequently, prior work has implied that currently available source code plagiarism detection tools are not robust to the application of pervasive plagiarism-hiding modifications. In this article, 11 source code plagiarism detection tools are evaluated for robustness against plagiarism-hiding modifications. The tools are evaluated with data sets of simulated undergraduate plagiarism, constructed with source code modifications representative of undergraduate students. The results of the performed evaluations indicate that currently available source code plagiarism detection tools are not robust against modifications which apply fine-grained transformations to the source code structure. Of the evaluated tools, JPlag and Plaggie demonstrates the greatest robustness to different types of plagiarism-hiding modifications. However, the results also indicate that graph-based tools (specifically those that compare programs as program dependence graphs) show potentially greater robustness to pervasive plagiarism-hiding modifications.</p></details> | 64 pages |

While there are several tools and techniques to efficiently determine plagiarism in text, the same cannot be said about source code plagiarism. To make the existing systems more efficient, we use several information retrieval techniques to find the similarity between source code files written in Java. We later use JPlag, which is a string-based plagiarism detection tool used in academia to match the plagiarized source codes. In this paper, we aim to generalize on the efficiency and effectiveness of detecting plagiarism using different information retrieval models rather than using just string manipulation algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Source Detection with Limited Time Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.12913v1)** | 2019-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the problem of utilizing network topology and partial timestamps to detect the information source in a network. The problem incurs prohibitive cost under canonical maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of the source due to the exponential number of possible infection paths. Our main idea of source detection, however, is to approximate the MLE by an alternative infection path based estimator, the essence of which is to identify the most likely infection path that is consistent with observed timestamps. The source node associated with that infection path is viewed as the estimated source $\hat{v}$. We first study the case of tree topology, where by transforming the infection path based estimator into a linear integer programming, we find a reduced search region that remarkably improves the time efficiency. Within this reduced search region, the estimator $\hat{v}$ is provably always on a path which we term as \emph{candidate path}. This notion enables us to analyze the distribution of $d(v^{\ast},\hat{v})$, the error distance between $\hat{v}$ and the true source $v^{\ast}$, on arbitrary tree, which allows us to obtain for the first time, in the literature provable performance guarantee of the estimator under limited timestamps. Specifically, on the infinite $g$-regular tree with uniform sampled timestamps, we get a refined performance guarantee in the sense of a constant bounded $d(v^{\ast},\hat{v})$. By virtue of time labeled BFS tree, the estimator still performs fairly well when extended to more general graphs. Experiments on both synthetic and real datasets further demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> | 15 pages |

| **[Source Identification for Mixtures of Product Distributions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.14540v1)** | 2021-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We give an algorithm for source identification of a mixture of $k$ product distributions on $n$ bits. This is a fundamental problem in machine learning with many applications. Our algorithm identifies the source parameters of an identifiable mixture, given, as input, approximate values of multilinear moments (derived, for instance, from a sufficiently large sample), using $2^{O(k^2)} n^{O(k)}$ arithmetic operations. Our result is the first explicit bound on the computational complexity of source identification of such mixtures. The running time improves previous results by Feldman, O'Donnell, and Servedio (FOCS 2005) and Chen and Moitra (STOC 2019) that guaranteed only learning the mixture (without parametric identification of the source). Our analysis gives a quantitative version of a qualitative characterization of identifiable sources that is due to Tahmasebi, Motahari, and Maddah-Ali (ISIT 2018).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Method for Identification and Ranking of Requirements Sources](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17034v1)** | 2023-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Requirements engineering (RE) literature acknowledges the importance of early stakeholder identification. The sources of requirements are many and also constantly changing as the market and business constantly change. Identifying and consulting all stakeholders on the market is impractical; thus many companies utilize indirect data sources, e.g. documents and representatives of larger groups of stakeholders. However, companies often collect irrelevant data or develop their products based on the sub-optimal information sources that may lead to missing market opportunities. We propose a collaborative method for identification and selection of data sources. The method consists of four steps and aims to build consensus between different perspectives in an organization. We demonstrate the use of the method with three industrial case studies. We have presented and statically validated the method to support prioritization of stakeholders for MDRE. Our results show that the method can support the identification and selection of data sources in three ways: (1) by providing systematic steps to identify and prioritize data sources for RE, (2) by highlighting and resolving discrepancies between different perspectives in an organization, and (3) by analyzing the underlying rationale for using certain data sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Source Identification on Networks with Statistical Confidence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04800v2)** | 2021-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion source identification on networks is a problem of fundamental importance in a broad class of applications, including rumor controlling and virus identification. Though this problem has received significant recent attention, most studies have focused only on very restrictive settings and lack theoretical guarantees for more realistic networks. We introduce a statistical framework for the study of diffusion source identification and develop a confidence set inference approach inspired by hypothesis testing. Our method efficiently produces a small subset of nodes, which provably covers the source node with any pre-specified confidence level without restrictive assumptions on network structures. Moreover, we propose multiple Monte Carlo strategies for the inference procedure based on network topology and the probabilistic properties that significantly improve the scalability. To our knowledge, this is the first diffusion source identification method with a practically useful theoretical guarantee on general networks. We demonstrate our approach via extensive synthetic experiments on well-known random network models and a mobility network between cities concerning the COVID-19 spreading.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification of Anomalous Diffusion Sources by Unsupervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02168v1)** | 2020-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is a ubiquitous diffusion process in which the memory effects of the stochastic transport result in the mean squared particle displacement following a power law, $\langle {Δr}^2 \rangle \sim t^α$, where the diffusion exponent $α$ characterizes whether the transport is subdiffusive, ($α<1$), diffusive ($α= 1$), or superdiffusive, ($α>1$). Due to the abundance of fBm processes in nature, significant efforts have been devoted to the identification and characterization of fBm sources in various phenomena. In practice, the identification of the fBm sources often relies on solving a complex and ill-posed inverse problem based on limited observed data. In the general case, the detected signals are formed by an unknown number of release sources, located at different locations and with different strengths, that act simultaneously. This means that the observed data is composed of mixtures of releases from an unknown number of sources, which makes the traditional inverse modeling approaches unreliable. Here, we report an unsupervised learning method, based on Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, that enables the identification of the unknown number of release sources as well the anomalous diffusion characteristics based on limited observed data and the general form of the corresponding fBm Green's function. We show that our method performs accurately for different types of sources and configurations with a predetermined number of sources with specific characteristics and introduced noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in physical review research</p></details> |

Most recent works deal with the scale of the problem by observing a subset of the nodes in the network, called sensors, to estimate the source. This paper addresses the problem of locating the source of a rumor in large social networks where some of these sensor nodes have failed. We estimate the missing information about the sensors using doubly non-negative (DN) matrix completion and compressed sensing techniques. This is then used to identify the actual source by using a maximum likelihood estimator we developed earlier, on a large data set from Sina Weibo. Results indicate that the estimation techniques result in almost as good a performance of the ML estimator as for the network for which complete information is available. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work on source identification with incomplete information in social networks.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing bio-inspired heuristic methods, we propose a model-based method that employs the AD-PDE to capture the transport phenomenon. Specifically, we formulate the Source Identification (SI) problem as a PDE-constrained optimization problem in function spaces. To obtain a tractable solution, we reduce the dimension of the concentration field using Proper Orthogonal Decomposition and approximate the unknown source field using nonlinear basis functions, drastically decreasing the number of unknowns. Moreover, to collect the concentration measurements, we control a robot sensor through a sequence of waypoints that maximize the smallest eigenvalue of the Fisher Information matrix of the unknown source parameters. Specifically, after every new measurement, a SI problem is solved to obtain a source estimate that is used to determine the next waypoint. We show that our algorithm can efficiently identify sources in complex AD systems and non-convex domains, in simulation and experimentally. This is the first time that PDEs are used for robotic SI in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 10 figures, journal</p></details> |

The existing techniques in source detection of digital videos try to find a fingerprint of the actual source in the video in form of PRNU (Photo Response Non--Uniformity), and match it against the SPN (Sensor Pattern Noise) of each possible device. The highest correlation indicates the correct source. We investigate the problem of identifying a video source through a feature based approach using machine learning. In this paper, we present a blind forensic technique of video source authentication and identification, based on feature extraction, feature selection and subsequent source classification. The main aim is to determine whether a claimed source for a video is actually its original source. If not, we identify its original source. Our experimental results prove the efficiency of the proposed method compared to traditional fingerprint based technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for inclusion in Xplore- Digital Library.

| **[A Hybrid Approach to Video Source Identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.01854v1)** | 2017-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimedia Forensics allows to determine whether videos or images have been captured with the same device, and thus, eventually, by the same person. Currently, the most promising technology to achieve this task, exploits the unique traces left by the camera sensor into the visual content. Anyway, image and video source identification are still treated separately from one another. This approach is limited and anachronistic if we consider that most of the visual media are today acquired using smartphones, that capture both images and videos. In this paper we overcome this limitation by exploring a new approach that allows to synergistically exploit images and videos to study the device from which they both come. Indeed, we prove it is possible to identify the source of a digital video by exploiting a reference sensor pattern noise generated from still images taken by the same device of the query video. The proposed method provides comparable or even better performance, when compared to the current video identification strategies, where a reference pattern is estimated from video frames. We also show how this strategy can be effective even in case of in-camera digitally stabilized videos, where a non-stabilized reference is not available, by solving some state-of-the-art limitations. We explore a possible direct application of this result, that is social media profile linking, i.e. discovering relationships between two or more social media profiles by comparing the visual contents - images or videos - shared therein.</p></details> |  |

Compression performance is measured in terms of Lagrangians, while identification performance is measured by the variational distance between the true source and the estimated source. Provided that the sources are mixing at a sufficiently fast rate and satisfy certain smoothness and Vapnik-Chervonenkis learnability conditions, it is shown that, for bounded metric distortions, there exist universal schemes for joint lossy compression and identification whose Lagrangian redundancies converge to zero as $\sqrt{V_n \log n /n}$ as the block length $n$ tends to infinity, where $V_n$ is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of a certain class of decision regions defined by the $n$-dimensional marginal distributions of the sources; furthermore, for each $n$, the decoder can identify $n$-dimensional marginal of the active source up to a ball of radius $O(\sqrt{V_n\log n/n})$ in variational distance, eventually with probability one. The results are supplemented by several examples of parametric sources satisfying the regularity conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 1 figure; accepted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |
| **[Subspace Identification for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.04723v2)** | 2023-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) methods aim to transfer knowledge from multiple labeled source domains to an unlabeled target domain. Although current methods achieve target joint distribution identifiability by enforcing minimal changes across domains, they often necessitate stringent conditions, such as an adequate number of domains, monotonic transformation of latent variables, and invariant label distributions. These requirements are challenging to satisfy in real-world applications. To mitigate the need for these strict assumptions, we propose a subspace identification theory that guarantees the disentanglement of domain-invariant and domain-specific variables under less restrictive constraints regarding domain numbers and transformation properties, thereby facilitating domain adaptation by minimizing the impact of domain shifts on invariant variables. Based on this theory, we develop a Subspace Identification Guarantee (SIG) model that leverages variational inference. Furthermore, the SIG model incorporates class-aware conditional alignment to accommodate target shifts where label distributions change with the domains. Experimental results demonstrate that our SIG model outperforms existing MSDA techniques on various benchmark datasets, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2023 Spotlight</p></details> |

Our overcomplete source identification algorithm, Cov-DL, leverages dictionary learning methods applied in the covariance-domain. Assuming that EEG sources are uncorrelated within moving time-windows and the scalp mixing is linear, the forward problem can be transferred to the covariance domain which has higher dimensionality than the original EEG channel domain. This allows for learning the overcomplete mixing matrix that generates the scalp EEG even when there may be more sources than sensors active at any time segment, i.e. when there are non-sparse sources. This is contrary to straight-forward dictionary learning methods that are based on the assumption of sparsity, which is not a satisfied condition in the case of low-density EEG systems. We present two different learning strategies for Cov-DL, determined by the size of the target mixing matrix. We demonstrate that Cov-DL outperforms existing overcomplete ICA algorithms under various scenarios of EEG simulations and real EEG experiments.</p></details> |  |

Source camera identification of web photos aims to establish a reliable linkage from the captured images to their source cameras, and has a broad range of applications, such as image copyright protection, user authentication, investigated evidence verification, etc. This paper presents an innovative and practical source identification framework that employs neural-network enhanced sensor pattern noise to trace back web photos efficiently while ensuring security. Our proposed framework consists of three main stages: initial device fingerprint registration, fingerprint extraction and cryptographic connection establishment while taking photos, and connection verification between photos and source devices. By incorporating metric learning and frequency consistency into the deep network design, our proposed fingerprint extraction algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on modern smartphone photos for reliable source identification. Meanwhile, we also propose several optimization sub-modules to prevent fingerprint leakage and improve accuracy and efficiency. Finally for practical system design, two cryptographic schemes are introduced to reliably identify the correlation between registered fingerprint and verified photo fingerprint, i.e. fuzzy extractor and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP).

It has vast importance in plagiarism detection, digital forensics, and several other law enforcement issues. However, when a source code segment is written by multiple authors, typical author identification methods no longer work. Here, an author identification technique, capable of predicting the authorship of source code segments, even in the case of multiple authors, has been proposed which uses a stacking ensemble classifier. This proposed technique is built upon several deep neural networks, random forests and support vector machine classifiers. It has been shown that for identifying the author group, a single classification technique is no longer sufficient and using a deep neural network-based stacking ensemble method can enhance the accuracy significantly. The performance of the proposed technique has been compared with some existing methods which only deal with the source code segments written precisely by a single author. Despite the harder task of authorship identification for source code segments written by multiple authors, our proposed technique has achieved promising results evidenced by the identification accuracy, compared to the related works which only deal with code segments written by a single author.</p></details> | <details><summary>2019 ...</summary><p>2019 22nd International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)</p></details> |

This has, however, made it easier for malicious users and institutions to copy the code without giving regards to the license, or credit to the original author. Therefore, source code author identification is a critical task with paramount importance. In this paper, we propose ICodeNet - a hierarchical neural network that can be used for source code file-level tasks. The ICodeNet processes source code in image format and is employed for the task of per file author identification. The ICodeNet consists of an ImageNet trained VGG encoder followed by a shallow neural network. The shallow network is based either on CNN or LSTM. Different variations of models are evaluated on a source code author classification dataset. We have also compared our image-based hierarchical neural network model with simple image-based CNN architecture and text-based CNN and LSTM models to highlight its novelty and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICMLC 2021</p></details> |

| **[GPU-accelerated SIFT-aided source identification of stabilized videos](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.14507v1)** | 2022-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video stabilization is an in-camera processing commonly applied by modern acquisition devices. While significantly improving the visual quality of the resulting videos, it has been shown that such operation typically hinders the forensic analysis of video signals. In fact, the correct identification of the acquisition source usually based on Photo Response non-Uniformity (PRNU) is subject to the estimation of the transformation applied to each frame in the stabilization phase. A number of techniques have been proposed for dealing with this problem, which however typically suffer from a high computational burden due to the grid search in the space of inversion parameters. Our work attempts to alleviate these shortcomings by exploiting the parallelization capabilities of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), typically used for deep learning applications, in the framework of stabilised frames inversion. Moreover, we propose to exploit SIFT features {to estimate the camera momentum and} %to identify less stabilized temporal segments, thus enabling a more accurate identification analysis, and to efficiently initialize the frame-wise parameter search of consecutive frames. Experiments on a consolidated benchmark dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the required computational time and improving the source identification accuracy. {The code is available at \url{https://github.com/AMontiB/GPU-PRNU-SIFT}}.</p></details> |  |
| **[CNN-based fast source device identification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11847v3)** | 2020-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source identification is an important topic in image forensics, since it allows to trace back the origin of an image. This represents a precious information to claim intellectual property but also to reveal the authors of illicit materials. In this paper we address the problem of device identification based on sensor noise and propose a fast and accurate solution using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Specifically, we propose a 2-channel-based CNN that learns a way of comparing camera fingerprint and image noise at patch level. The proposed solution turns out to be much faster than the conventional approach and to ensure an increased accuracy. This makes the approach particularly suitable in scenarios where large databases of images are analyzed, like over social networks. In this vein, since images uploaded on social media usually undergo at least two compression stages, we include investigations on double JPEG compressed images, always reporting higher accuracy than standard approaches.</p></details> |  |

The WildlifeDatasets is written in Python, allows straightforward access to publicly available wildlife datasets, and provides a wide variety of methods for dataset pre-processing, performance analysis, and model fine-tuning. We showcase the toolkit in various scenarios and baseline experiments, including, to the best of our knowledge, the most comprehensive experimental comparison of datasets and methods for wildlife re-identification, including both local descriptors and deep learning approaches. Furthermore, we provide the first-ever foundation model for individual re-identification within a wide range of species - MegaDescriptor - that provides state-of-the-art performance on animal re-identification datasets and outperforms other pre-trained models such as CLIP and DINOv2 by a significant margin. To make the model available to the general public and to allow easy integration with any existing wildlife monitoring applications, we provide multiple MegaDescriptor flavors (i.e., Small, Medium, and Large) through the HuggingFace hub (https://huggingface.co/BVRA).</p></details> |  |
| **[Infection Spreading and Source Identification: A Hide and Seek Game](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.04796v2)** | 2016-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of an infection source node (e.g., a rumor or computer virus source) in a network is to spread its infection to as many nodes as possible, while remaining hidden from the network administrator. On the other hand, the network administrator aims to identify the source node based on knowledge of which nodes have been infected. We model the infection spreading and source identification problem as a strategic game, where the infection source and the network administrator are the two players. As the Jordan center estimator is a minimax source estimator that has been shown to be robust in recent works, we assume that the network administrator utilizes a source estimation strategy that can probe any nodes within a given radius of the Jordan center. Given any estimation strategy, we design a best-response infection strategy for the source. Given any infection strategy, we design a best-response estimation strategy for the network administrator. We derive conditions under which a Nash equilibrium of the strategic game exists. Simulations in both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed infection strategy infects more nodes while maintaining the same safety margin between the true source node and the Jordan center source estimator.</p></details> |  |

However, there is still a lack of neural network-based methods for point source identification, mainly due to the inherent solution singularity. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm to identify point sources, utilizing a neural network combined with a singularity enrichment technique. We employ the fundamental solution and neural networks to represent the singular and regular parts, respectively, and then minimize an empirical loss involving the intensities and locations of the unknown point sources, as well as the parameters of the neural network. Moreover, by combining the conditional stability argument of the inverse problem with the generalization error of the empirical loss, we conduct a rigorous error analysis of the algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with several challenging experiments.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Sequential Attention Source Identification Based on Feature Representation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.15886v1)** | 2024-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snapshot observation based source localization has been widely studied due to its accessibility and low cost. However, the interaction of users in existing methods does not be addressed in time-varying infection scenarios. So these methods have a decreased accuracy in heterogeneous interaction scenarios. To solve this critical issue, this paper proposes a sequence-to-sequence based localization framework called Temporal-sequence based Graph Attention Source Identification (TGASI) based on an inductive learning idea. More specifically, the encoder focuses on generating multiple features by estimating the influence probability between two users, and the decoder distinguishes the importance of prediction sources in different timestamps by a designed temporal attention mechanism. It's worth mentioning that the inductive learning idea ensures that TGASI can detect the sources in new scenarios without knowing other prior knowledge, which proves the scalability of TGASI. Comprehensive experiments with the SOTA methods demonstrate the higher detection performance and scalability in different scenarios of TGASI.</p></details> |  |

The system comprises two steps: first, acoustic properties are calculated based on spectral and spatial information. Second, clustering is performed based on these properties. The clustering aims at helping and guiding an expert for quick identification of different source types, providing an understanding of how sources differ. This supports the expert in determining similar or atypical behavior. A variety of features are proposed for capturing the characteristics of the sources. These features represent aeroacoustic properties that can be interpreted by both the machine and by experts. The features are independent of the absolute Mach number which enables the proposed method to cluster data measured at different flow configurations. The method is evaluated on deconvolved beamforming data from two scaled airframe half-model measurements. For this exemplary data, the proposed support system method results in clusters that mostly correspond to the source types identified by the authors. The clustering also provides the mean feature values and the cluster hierarchy for each cluster and for each cluster member a clustering confidence. This additional information makes the results transparent and allows the expert to understand the clustering choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint for JASA Journal</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Source Identification Game with Corrupted Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.09244v1)** | 2017-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a variant of the source identification game with training data in which part of the training data is corrupted by an attacker. In the addressed scenario, the defender aims at deciding whether a test sequence has been drawn according to a discrete memoryless source $X \sim P_X$, whose statistics are known to him through the observation of a training sequence generated by $X$. In order to undermine the correct decision under the alternative hypothesis that the test sequence has not been drawn from $X$, the attacker can modify a sequence produced by a source $Y \sim P_Y$ up to a certain distortion, and corrupt the training sequence either by adding some fake samples or by replacing some samples with fake ones. We derive the unique rationalizable equilibrium of the two versions of the game in the asymptotic regime and by assuming that the defender bases its decision by relying only on the first order statistics of the test and the training sequences. By mimicking Stein's lemma, we derive the best achievable performance for the defender when the first type error probability is required to tend to zero exponentially fast with an arbitrarily small, yet positive, error exponent. We then use such a result to analyze the ultimate distinguishability of any two sources as a function of the allowed distortion and the fraction of corrupted samples injected into the training sequence.</p></details> |  |

A source printer identification technique can be employed as a countermeasure to those forgeries. This paper presents a color laser printer identification method based on cascaded learning of deep neural networks. The refiner network is trained by adversarial training to refine the synthetic dataset for halftone color decomposition. The halftone color decomposing ConvNet is trained with the refined dataset, and the trained knowledge is transferred to the printer identifying ConvNet to enhance the accuracy. The robustness about rotation and scaling is considered in training process, which is not considered in existing methods.

The pollution is assumed to be instantaneously released once. The problem can be formulated as a non-convex loss minimization problem in statistical learning, and our online algorithms have vectorized and adaptive step sizes to ensure high estimation accuracy in three dimensions which have different magnitudes. In order to keep the algorithm from stucking to the saddle points of non-convex loss, the escaping from saddle points module and multi-start setting are derived to further improve the estimation accuracy by searching for the global minimizer of the loss functions. This can be shown theoretically and experimentally as the $O(N)$ local regret of the algorithms and the high probability cumulative regret bound $O(N)$ under a particular error bound condition in loss functions. A real-life river pollution source identification example shows the superior performance of our algorithms compared to existing methods in terms of estimation accuracy. Managerial insights for the decision maker to use the algorithms are also provided.</p></details> |  |

It allows for reliable device identification and effective detection and localization of image forgeries, in very general conditions. However, performance impairs significantly in challenging conditions involving low quality and quantity of data. These include working on compressed and cropped images, or estimating the camera PRNU pattern based on only a few images. To boost the performance of PRNU-based analyses in such conditions we propose to leverage the image noiseprint, a recently proposed camera-model fingerprint that has proved effective for several forensic tasks. Numerical experiments on datasets widely used for source identification prove that the proposed method ensures a significant performance improvement in a wide range of challenging situations.</p></details> |  |

With the advancement of observational technology, especially with the advent of large-scale telescope projects such as FAST and SKA, the significant increase in data volume presents new challenges for the efficiency and accuracy of data processing.To address this challenge, in this study, we present a machine learning-based method for extracting \hi\ sources from the three-dimensional (3D) spectral data obtained from the Commensal Radio Astronomy FAST Survey (CRAFTS). We have carefully assembled a specialized dataset, HISF, rich in \hi\ sources, specifically designed to enhance the detection process. Our model, Unet-LK, utilizes the advanced 3D-Unet segmentation architecture and employs an elongated convolution kernel to effectively capture the intricate structures of \hi\ sources. This strategy ensures a reliable identification and segmentation of \hi\ sources, achieving notable performance metrics with a recall rate of 91.6\% and an accuracy of 95.7\%. These results substantiate the robustness of our dataset and the effectiveness of our proposed network architecture in the precise identification of \hi\ sources.

In OUDA, person Re-ID models face two main challenges: catastrophic forgetting and domain shift. In this work, we propose a new Source-guided Similarity Preservation (S2P) framework to alleviate these two problems. Our framework is based on the extraction of a support set composed of source images that maximizes the similarity with the target data. This support set is used to identify feature similarities that must be preserved during the learning process. S2P can incorporate multiple existing UDA methods to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Our experiments show that S2P outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple real-to-real and synthetic-to-real challenging OUDA benchmarks.</p></details> | WACV 2024 |

This paper proposes a procedure for the identification of the image source and content by using the Public Key Cryptography Signature (PKCS). The procedure is based on the PKCS watermarking of the images captured with numerous automatic observing cameras in the Trap View cloud system. Watermark is created based on 32-bit PKCS serial number and embedded into the captured image. Watermark detection on the receiver side extracts the serial number and indicates the camera which captured the image by comparing the original and the extracted serial numbers. The watermarking procedure is designed to provide robustness to image optimization based on the Compressive Sensing approach. Also, the procedure is tested under various attacks and shows successful identification of ownership.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to MIPRO 2017 conference, Opatija, Croatia</p></details> |

Historically, conventional machine learning approaches that heavily rely on extensive feature engineering have outperformed transformer-based language models on this task. Recently, closed-source generative large language models (LLMs), e.g., GPT-4, have demonstrated remarkable performance on NLI in a zero-shot setting, including promising results in open-set classification. However, closed-source LLMs have many disadvantages, such as high costs and undisclosed nature of training data. This study explores the potential of using open-source LLMs for NLI. Our results indicate that open-source LLMs do not reach the accuracy levels of closed-source LLMs when used out-of-the-box. However, when fine-tuned on labeled training data, open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to that of commercial LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The ability to trace the origin of an image/video can aid law enforcement agencies in gathering evidence and constructing the timeline of events. Moreover, identifying the owner of a certain device narrows down the area of search in a criminal investigation where smartphone devices are involved. This paper proposes a new pixel-based method for source camera identification, integrating Pixel Difference Convolution (PDC) with a Vision Transformer network (ViT), and named PDC-ViT. While the PDC acts as the backbone for feature extraction by exploiting Angular PDC (APDC) and Radial PDC (RPDC). These techniques enhance the capability to capture subtle variations in pixel information, which are crucial for distinguishing between different source cameras. The second part of the methodology focuses on classification, which is based on a Vision Transformer network. Unlike traditional methods that utilize image patches directly for training the classification network, the proposed approach uniquely inputs PDC features into the Vision Transformer network. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the PDC-ViT approach, it has been assessed on five different datasets, which include various image contents and video scenes. The method has also been compared with state-of-the-art source camera identification methods. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed system in terms of accuracy and robustness when compared to its competitors. For example, our proposed PDC-ViT has achieved an accuracy of 94.30%, 84%, 94.22% and 92.29% using the Vision dataset, Daxing dataset, Socrates dataset and QUFVD dataset, respectively.</p></details> |  |

| **[Source Localization for Cross Network Information Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14668v1)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source localization aims to locate information diffusion sources only given the diffusion observation, which has attracted extensive attention in the past few years. Existing methods are mostly tailored for single networks and may not be generalized to handle more complex networks like cross-networks. Cross-network is defined as two interconnected networks, where one network's functionality depends on the other. Source localization on cross-networks entails locating diffusion sources on the source network by only giving the diffused observation in the target network. The task is challenging due to challenges including: 1) diffusion sources distribution modeling; 2) jointly considering both static and dynamic node features; and 3) heterogeneous diffusion patterns learning. In this work, we propose a novel method, namely CNSL, to handle the three primary challenges. Specifically, we propose to learn the distribution of diffusion sources through Bayesian inference and leverage disentangled encoders to separately learn static and dynamic node features. The learning objective is coupled with the cross-network information propagation estimation model to make the inference of diffusion sources considering the overall diffusion process. Additionally, we also provide two novel cross-network datasets collected by ourselves. Extensive experiments are conducted on both datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{CNSL} in handling the source localization on cross-networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data are available at: https://github.com/tanmoysr/CNSL/</p></details> |

Our proposed DMSFDA method involves fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to generate source domain images using features from the target images to guide the diffusion process. Specifically, the pre-trained diffusion model is fine-tuned to generate source samples that minimize entropy and maximize confidence for the pre-trained source model. We then use a diffusion model-based image mixup strategy to bridge the domain gap between the source and target domains. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments across a range of datasets, including Office-31, Office-Home, and VisDA. The results demonstrate significant improvements in SFDA performance, highlighting the potential of diffusion models in generating contextually relevant, domain-specific images.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2310.01701</p></details> |
| **[Social Diffusion Sources Can Escape Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10539v2)** | 2022-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influencing (and being influenced by) others through social networks is fundamental to all human societies. Whether this happens through the diffusion of rumors, opinions, or viruses, identifying the diffusion source (i.e., the person that initiated it) is a problem that has attracted much research interest. Nevertheless, existing literature has ignored the possibility that the source might strategically modify the network structure (by rewiring links or introducing fake nodes) to escape detection. Here, without restricting our analysis to any particular diffusion scenario, we close this gap by evaluating two mechanisms that hide the source-one stemming from the source's actions, the other from the network structure itself. This reveals that sources can easily escape detection, and that removing links is far more effective than introducing fake nodes. Thus, efforts should focus on exposing concealed ties rather than planted entities; such exposure would drastically improve our chances of detecting the diffusion source.</p></details> | <details><summary>100 p...</summary><p>100 pages, 80 figures</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Source Music Generation with Latent Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06190v4)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most music generation models directly generate a single music mixture. To allow for more flexible and controllable generation, the Multi-Source Diffusion Model (MSDM) has been proposed to model music as a mixture of multiple instrumental sources (e.g. piano, drums, bass, and guitar). Its goal is to use one single diffusion model to generate mutually-coherent music sources, that are then mixed to form the music. Despite its capabilities, MSDM is unable to generate music with rich melodies and often generates empty sounds. Its waveform diffusion approach also introduces significant Gaussian noise artifacts that compromise audio quality. In response, we introduce a Multi-Source Latent Diffusion Model (MSLDM) that employs Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to encode each instrumental source into a distinct latent representation. By training a VAE on all music sources, we efficiently capture each source's unique characteristics in a "source latent." The source latents are concatenated and our diffusion model learns this joint latent space. This approach significantly enhances the total and partial generation of music by leveraging the VAE's latent compression and noise-robustness. The compressed source latent also facilitates more efficient generation. Subjective listening tests and Frechet Audio Distance (FAD) scores confirm that our model outperforms MSDM, showcasing its practical and enhanced applicability in music generation systems. We also emphasize that modeling sources is more effective than direct music mixture modeling. Codes and models are available at https://github.com/XZWY/MSLDM. Demos are available at https://xzwy.github.io/MSLDMDemo/.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Invertible Graph Diffusion Neural Network for Source Localization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.09214v1)** | 2022-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Localizing the source of graph diffusion phenomena, such as misinformation propagation, is an important yet extremely challenging task. Existing source localization models typically are heavily dependent on the hand-crafted rules. Unfortunately, a large portion of the graph diffusion process for many applications is still unknown to human beings so it is important to have expressive models for learning such underlying rules automatically. This paper aims to establish a generic framework of invertible graph diffusion models for source localization on graphs, namely Invertible Validity-aware Graph Diffusion (IVGD), to handle major challenges including 1) Difficulty to leverage knowledge in graph diffusion models for modeling their inverse processes in an end-to-end fashion, 2) Difficulty to ensure the validity of the inferred sources, and 3) Efficiency and scalability in source inference. Specifically, first, to inversely infer sources of graph diffusion, we propose a graph residual scenario to make existing graph diffusion models invertible with theoretical guarantees; second, we develop a novel error compensation mechanism that learns to offset the errors of the inferred sources. Finally, to ensure the validity of the inferred sources, a new set of validity-aware layers have been devised to project inferred sources to feasible regions by flexibly encoding constraints with unrolled optimization techniques. A linearization technique is proposed to strengthen the efficiency of our proposed layers. The convergence of the proposed IVGD is proven theoretically.

| **[Identification of Anomalous Diffusion Sources by Unsupervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.02168v1)** | 2020-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is a ubiquitous diffusion process in which the memory effects of the stochastic transport result in the mean squared particle displacement following a power law, $\langle {Δr}^2 \rangle \sim t^α$, where the diffusion exponent $α$ characterizes whether the transport is subdiffusive, ($α<1$), diffusive ($α= 1$), or superdiffusive, ($α>1$). Due to the abundance of fBm processes in nature, significant efforts have been devoted to the identification and characterization of fBm sources in various phenomena. In practice, the identification of the fBm sources often relies on solving a complex and ill-posed inverse problem based on limited observed data. In the general case, the detected signals are formed by an unknown number of release sources, located at different locations and with different strengths, that act simultaneously. This means that the observed data is composed of mixtures of releases from an unknown number of sources, which makes the traditional inverse modeling approaches unreliable. Here, we report an unsupervised learning method, based on Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, that enables the identification of the unknown number of release sources as well the anomalous diffusion characteristics based on limited observed data and the general form of the corresponding fBm Green's function. We show that our method performs accurately for different types of sources and configurations with a predetermined number of sources with specific characteristics and introduced noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in physical review research</p></details> |
| **[Source Localization of Graph Diffusion via Variational Autoencoders for Graph Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12327v1)** | 2022-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph diffusion problems such as the propagation of rumors, computer viruses, or smart grid failures are ubiquitous and societal. Hence it is usually crucial to identify diffusion sources according to the current graph diffusion observations. Despite its tremendous necessity and significance in practice, source localization, as the inverse problem of graph diffusion, is extremely challenging as it is ill-posed: different sources may lead to the same graph diffusion patterns. Different from most traditional source localization methods, this paper focuses on a probabilistic manner to account for the uncertainty of different candidate sources. Such endeavors require overcoming challenges including 1) the uncertainty in graph diffusion source localization is hard to be quantified; 2) the complex patterns of the graph diffusion sources are difficult to be probabilistically characterized; 3) the generalization under any underlying diffusion patterns is hard to be imposed. To solve the above challenges, this paper presents a generic framework: Source Localization Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) for locating the diffusion sources under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Particularly, we propose a probabilistic model that leverages the forward diffusion estimation model along with deep generative models to approximate the diffusion source distribution for quantifying the uncertainty. SL-VAE further utilizes prior knowledge of the source-observation pairs to characterize the complex patterns of diffusion sources by a learned generative prior. Lastly, a unified objective that integrates the forward diffusion estimation model is derived to enforce the model to generalize under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted on 7 real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SL-VAE in reconstructing the diffusion sources by excelling other methods on average 20% in AUC score.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, accepted by SIGKDD 2022</p></details> |

When the degree of each node is at least three, we show that it is possible to construct confidence sets for the diffusion source with size independent of the number of infected nodes. Our estimators are motivated by analogous results in the literature concerning identification of the root node in preferential attachment and uniform attachment trees. At the core of our proofs is a probabilistic analysis of Pólya urns corresponding to the number of uninfected neighbors in specific subtrees of the infection tree. We also provide an example illustrating the shortcomings of source estimation techniques in settings where the underlying graph is asymmetric.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[Diffusion Source Identification on Networks with Statistical Confidence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04800v2)** | 2021-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion source identification on networks is a problem of fundamental importance in a broad class of applications, including rumor controlling and virus identification. Though this problem has received significant recent attention, most studies have focused only on very restrictive settings and lack theoretical guarantees for more realistic networks. We introduce a statistical framework for the study of diffusion source identification and develop a confidence set inference approach inspired by hypothesis testing. Our method efficiently produces a small subset of nodes, which provably covers the source node with any pre-specified confidence level without restrictive assumptions on network structures. Moreover, we propose multiple Monte Carlo strategies for the inference procedure based on network topology and the probabilistic properties that significantly improve the scalability. To our knowledge, this is the first diffusion source identification method with a practically useful theoretical guarantee on general networks. We demonstrate our approach via extensive synthetic experiments on well-known random network models and a mobility network between cities concerning the COVID-19 spreading.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-based Generative Speech Source Separation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.17327v2)** | 2022-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose DiffSep, a new single channel source separation method based on score-matching of a stochastic differential equation (SDE). We craft a tailored continuous time diffusion-mixing process starting from the separated sources and converging to a Gaussian distribution centered on their mixture. This formulation lets us apply the machinery of score-based generative modelling. First, we train a neural network to approximate the score function of the marginal probabilities or the diffusion-mixing process. Then, we use it to solve the reverse time SDE that progressively separates the sources starting from their mixture. We propose a modified training strategy to handle model mismatch and source permutation ambiguity. Experiments on the WSJ0 2mix dataset demonstrate the potential of the method. Furthermore, the method is also suitable for speech enhancement and shows performance competitive with prior work on the VoiceBank-DEMAND dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Separating diffuse from point-like sources - a Bayesian approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.05591v3)** | 2018-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the starblade algorithm, a method to separate superimposed point sources from auto-correlated, diffuse flux using a Bayesian model. Point sources are assumed to be independent from each other and to follow a power-law brightness distribution. The diffuse emission is described as a non-parametric log-normal model with a priori unknown correlation structure. This model enforces positivity of the underlying emission and allows for variation in the order of magnitudes. The correlation structure is recovered non-parametrically in addition to the diffuse flux and is used for the separation of the point sources. Additionally many measurement artifacts appear as point-like or quasi-point-like effects, not compatible with superimposed diffuse emission. An estimate of the separation uncertainty can be provided as well. We demonstrate the capabilities of the derived method on synthetic data and data obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope, emphasizing its effect on instrumental artifacts as well as physical sources. The performance of this method is compared to the background estimation of the SExtractor method, as well as to a denoising auto-encoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who Made This? Fake Detection and Source Attribution with Diffusion Features](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.27602v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones, raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing supervised detectors often struggle to generalize across unseen generators, requiring extensive labeled data and frequent retraining. We introduce FRIDA (Fake-image Recognition and source Identification via Diffusion-features Analysis), a lightweight framework that leverages internal activations from a pre-trained diffusion model for deepfake detection and source generator attribution. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier applied to diffusion features achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance without fine-tuning, while a compact neural model enables accurate source attribution. These results show that diffusion representations inherently encode generator-specific patterns, providing a simple and interpretable foundation for synthetic image forensics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Multi-Source Inference for Text Conditioned Music Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11706v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Source Diffusion Models (MSDM) allow for compositional musical generation tasks: generating a set of coherent sources, creating accompaniments, and performing source separation. Despite their versatility, they require estimating the joint distribution over the sources, necessitating pre-separated musical data, which is rarely available, and fixing the number and type of sources at training time. This paper generalizes MSDM to arbitrary time-domain diffusion models conditioned on text embeddings. These models do not require separated data as they are trained on mixtures, can parameterize an arbitrary number of sources, and allow for rich semantic control. We propose an inference procedure enabling the coherent generation of sources and accompaniments. Additionally, we adapt the Dirac separator of MSDM to perform source separation. We experiment with diffusion models trained on Slakh2100 and MTG-Jamendo, showcasing competitive generation and separation results in a relaxed data setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Rumor source detection with multiple observations under adaptive diffusions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11211v1)** | 2020-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work, motivated by anonymous messaging platforms, has introduced adaptive diffusion protocols which can obfuscate the source of a rumor: a "snapshot adversary" with access to the subgraph of "infected" nodes can do no better than randomly guessing the entity of the source node. What happens if the adversary has access to multiple independent snapshots? We study this question when the underlying graph is the infinite $d$-regular tree. We show that (1) a weak form of source obfuscation is still possible in the case of two independent snapshots, but (2) already with three observations there is a simple algorithm that finds the rumor source with constant probability, regardless of the adaptive diffusion protocol. We also characterize the tradeoff between local spreading and source obfuscation for adaptive diffusion protocols (under a single snapshot). These results raise questions about the robustness of anonymity guarantees when spreading information in social networks.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Back to the Source: Diffusion-Driven Test-Time Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.03442v2)** | 2023-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation harnesses test inputs to improve the accuracy of a model trained on source data when tested on shifted target data. Existing methods update the source model by (re-)training on each target domain. While effective, re-training is sensitive to the amount and order of the data and the hyperparameters for optimization. We instead update the target data, by projecting all test inputs toward the source domain with a generative diffusion model. Our diffusion-driven adaptation method, DDA, shares its models for classification and generation across all domains. Both models are trained on the source domain, then fixed during testing. We augment diffusion with image guidance and self-ensembling to automatically decide how much to adapt. Input adaptation by DDA is more robust than prior model adaptation approaches across a variety of corruptions, architectures, and data regimes on the ImageNet-C benchmark. With its input-wise updates, DDA succeeds where model adaptation degrades on too little data in small batches, dependent data in non-uniform order, or mixed data with multiple corruptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published at CVPR 2023</p></details> |

To address the typically slow iterative sampling process of diffusion models, we apply consistency distillation and reduce the sampling process to a single step, achieving performance comparable to that of diffusion models, and with two or more steps, even surpassing them. Trained on the Slakh2100 dataset for four instruments (bass, drums, guitar, and piano), our model shows significant improvements across objective metrics compared to baseline methods.

| **[Catch'Em All: Locating Multiple Diffusion Sources in Networks with Partial Observations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.06963v1)** | 2016-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the problem of locating multiple diffusion sources in networks with partial observations. We propose a new source localization algorithm, named Optimal-Jordan-Cover (OJC). The algorithm first extracts a subgraph using a candidate selection algorithm that selects source candidates based on the number of observed infected nodes in their neighborhoods. Then, in the extracted subgraph, OJC finds a set of nodes that "cover" all observed infected nodes with the minimum radius. The set of nodes is called the Jordan cover, and is regarded as the set of diffusion sources. Considering the heterogeneous susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) diffusion in the Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graph, we prove that OJC can locate all sources with probability one asymptotically with partial observations. OJC is a polynomial-time algorithm in terms of network size. However, the computational complexity increases exponentially in $m,$ the number of sources. We further propose a low-complexity heuristic based on the K-Means for approximating the Jordan cover, named Approximate-Jordan-Cover (AJC). Simulations on random graphs and real networks demonstrate that both AJC and OJC significantly outperform other heuristic algorithms.</p></details> | 16 figures |
| **[Separate And Diffuse: Using a Pretrained Diffusion Model for Improving Source Separation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.10752v2)** | 2023-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of speech separation, also known as the cocktail party problem, refers to the task of isolating a single speech signal from a mixture of speech signals. Previous work on source separation derived an upper bound for the source separation task in the domain of human speech. This bound is derived for deterministic models. Recent advancements in generative models challenge this bound. We show how the upper bound can be generalized to the case of random generative models. Applying a diffusion model Vocoder that was pretrained to model single-speaker voices on the output of a deterministic separation model leads to state-of-the-art separation results. It is shown that this requires one to combine the output of the separation model with that of the diffusion model. In our method, a linear combination is performed, in the frequency domain, using weights that are inferred by a learned model. We show state-of-the-art results on 2, 3, 5, 10, and 20 speakers on multiple benchmarks. In particular, for two speakers, our method is able to surpass what was previously considered the upper performance bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Localization of Diffusion Sources in Complex Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.04915v1)** | 2017-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating sources of diffusion and spreading from minimum data is a significant problem in network science with great applied values to the society. However, a general theoretical framework dealing with optimal source localization is lacking. Combining the controllability theory for complex networks and compressive sensing, we develop a framework with high efficiency and robustness for optimal source localization in arbitrary weighted networks with arbitrary distribution of sources. We offer a minimum output analysis to quantify the source locatability through a minimal number of messenger nodes that produce sufficient measurement for fully locating the sources. When the minimum messenger nodes are discerned, the problem of optimal source localization becomes one of sparse signal reconstruction, which can be solved using compressive sensing. Application of our framework to model and empirical networks demonstrates that sources in homogeneous and denser networks are more readily to be located. A surprising finding is that, for a connected undirected network with random link weights and weak noise, a single messenger node is sufficient for locating any number of sources. The framework deepens our understanding of the network source localization problem and offers efficient tools with broad applications.</p></details> | 6 figures |

Being able to do so is critical for curtailing the spread of malicious information, and reducing the potential losses incurred. This is a very challenging problem since typically only incomplete traces are observed and we need to unroll the incomplete traces into the past in order to pinpoint the source. In this paper, we tackle this problem by developing a two-stage framework, which first learns a continuous-time diffusion network model based on historical diffusion traces and then identifies the source of an incomplete diffusion trace by maximizing the likelihood of the trace under the learned model. Experiments on both large synthetic and real-world data show that our framework can effectively go back to the past, and pinpoint the source node and its initiation time significantly more accurately than previous state-of-the-arts.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 18th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2015</p></details> |

Examples of this source separation task include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source. Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution. The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors, evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as real-world galaxy observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to main conference of NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Source Prompt Disentangled Inversion for Boosting Image Editability with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11105v2)** | 2024-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-driven diffusion models have significantly advanced the image editing performance by using text prompts as inputs. One crucial step in text-driven image editing is to invert the original image into a latent noise code conditioned on the source prompt. While previous methods have achieved promising results by refactoring the image synthesizing process, the inverted latent noise code is tightly coupled with the source prompt, limiting the image editability by target text prompts. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Source Prompt Disentangled Inversion (SPDInv), which aims at reducing the impact of source prompt, thereby enhancing the text-driven image editing performance by employing diffusion models. To make the inverted noise code be independent of the given source prompt as much as possible, we indicate that the iterative inversion process should satisfy a fixed-point constraint. Consequently, we transform the inversion problem into a searching problem to find the fixed-point solution, and utilize the pre-trained diffusion models to facilitate the searching process. The experimental results show that our proposed SPDInv method can effectively mitigate the conflicts between the target editing prompt and the source prompt, leading to a significant decrease in editing artifacts. In addition to text-driven image editing, with SPDInv we can easily adapt customized image generation models to localized editing tasks and produce promising performance. The source code are available at https://github.com/leeruibin/SPDInv.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-stage Denoising Diffusion Model for Source Localization in Graph Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08841v1)** | 2023-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source localization is the inverse problem of graph information dissemination and has broad practical applications. However, the inherent intricacy and uncertainty in information dissemination pose significant challenges, and the ill-posed nature of the source localization problem further exacerbates these challenges. Recently, deep generative models, particularly diffusion models inspired by classical non-equilibrium thermodynamics, have made significant progress. While diffusion models have proven to be powerful in solving inverse problems and producing high-quality reconstructions, applying them directly to the source localization is infeasible for two reasons. Firstly, it is impossible to calculate the posterior disseminated results on a large-scale network for iterative denoising sampling, which would incur enormous computational costs. Secondly, in the existing methods for this field, the training data itself are ill-posed (many-to-one); thus simply transferring the diffusion model would only lead to local optima. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage optimization framework, the source localization denoising diffusion model (SL-Diff). In the coarse stage, we devise the source proximity degrees as the supervised signals to generate coarse-grained source predictions. This aims to efficiently initialize the next stage, significantly reducing its convergence time and calibrating the convergence process. Furthermore, the introduction of cascade temporal information in this training method transforms the many-to-one mapping relationship into a one-to-one relationship, perfectly addressing the ill-posed problem. In the fine stage, we design a diffusion model for the graph inverse problem that can quantify the uncertainty in the dissemination. The proposed SL-Diff yields excellent prediction results within a reasonable sampling time at extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |

Existing relighting methods either rely on multiple input views to perform inverse rendering at inference time, or fail to provide explicit control over light changes. Our method fine-tunes a diffusion model on a small set of real raw photograph pairs, supplemented by synthetically rendered images at scale, to elicit its photorealistic prior for relighting. We leverage the linearity of light to synthesize image pairs depicting controlled light changes of either a target light source or ambient illumination. Using this data and an appropriate fine-tuning scheme, we train a model for precise illumination changes with explicit control over light intensity and color. Lastly, we show how our method can achieve compelling light editing results, and outperforms existing methods based on user preference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://nadmag.github.io/LightLab/</p></details> |

Existing approaches predominantly focus on Euclidean data, such as images and videos, while the exploration of non-Euclidean graph data remains scarce. Recent graph neural network (GNN) approaches can suffer from serious performance decline due to domain shift and label scarcity in source-free adaptation scenarios. In this study, we propose a novel method named Graph Diffusion-based Alignment with Jigsaw (GALA), tailored for source-free graph domain adaptation. To achieve domain alignment, GALA employs a graph diffusion model to reconstruct source-style graphs from target data. Specifically, a score-based graph diffusion model is trained using source graphs to learn the generative source styles. Then, we introduce perturbations to target graphs via a stochastic differential equation instead of sampling from a prior, followed by the reverse process to reconstruct source-style graphs. We feed the source-style graphs into an off-the-shelf GNN and introduce class-specific thresholds with curriculum learning, which can generate accurate and unbiased pseudo-labels for target graphs. Moreover, we develop a simple yet effective graph-mixing strategy named graph jigsaw to combine confident graphs and unconfident graphs, which can enhance generalization capabilities and robustness via consistency learning. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of GALA.</p></details> | IEEE TPAMI |

The measurements of tracer concentration are sporadic, noisy and without directional information. The search domain is discretised and modelled by a finite two-dimensional lattice. The links is the lattice represent the traversable paths for emitted particles and for the searcher. A missing link in the lattice indicates a blocked paths, due to the walls or obstacles. The searcher must simultaneously estimate the source parameters, the map of the search domain and its own location within the map. The solution is formulated in the sequential Bayesian framework and implemented as a Rao-Blackwellised particle filter with information-driven motion control. The numerical results demonstrate the concept and its performance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

An accurate localization of the source is inherently limited by our ability to simultaneously access the information of all nodes in a large-scale complex network. This thus raises two critical questions: how do we locate the source from incomplete information and can we achieve full localization of sources at any possible location from a given set of observable nodes. Here we develop a time-reversal backward spreading algorithm to locate the source of a diffusion-like process efficiently and propose a general locatability condition. We test the algorithm by employing epidemic spreading and consensus dynamics as typical dynamical processes and apply it to the H1N1 pandemic in China. We find that the sources can be precisely located in arbitrary networks insofar as the locatability condition is assured. Our tools greatly improve our ability to locate the source of diffusion in complex networks based on limited accessibility of nodal information. Moreover, they have implications for controlling a variety of dynamical processes taking place on complex networks, such as inhibiting epidemics, slowing the spread of rumors, pollution control and environmental protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Current approaches predominantly treat CSI compression as a source coding problem, neglecting transmission errors. In finite block length regimes, separate source and channel coding proves suboptimal, with reconstruction performance deteriorating significantly under challenging channel conditions. While existing autoencoder-based compression schemes can be readily extended to support joint source-channel coding, they struggle to capture complex channel distributions and exhibit poor scalability with increasing parameter count. To overcome these inherent limitations of autoencoder-based approaches, we propose Residual-Diffusion Joint Source-Channel Coding (RD-JSCC), a novel framework that integrates a lightweight autoencoder with a residual diffusion module to iteratively refine CSI reconstruction. Our flexible decoding strategy balances computational efficiency and performance by dynamically switching between low-complexity autoencoder decoding and sophisticated diffusion-based refinement based on channel conditions. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that RD-JSCC significantly outperforms existing autoencoder-based approaches in challenging wireless environments. Furthermore, RD-JSCC offers several practical features, including a low-latency 2-step diffusion during inference, support for multiple compression rates with a single model, robustness to fixed-bit quantization, and adaptability to imperfect channel estimation.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

| **[Detection of Rumors and Their Sources in Social Networks: A Comprehensive Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.05292v1)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent advancements in social network platform technology, an overwhelming amount of information is spreading rapidly. In this situation, it can become increasingly difficult to discern what information is false or true. If false information proliferates significantly, it can lead to undesirable outcomes. Hence, when we receive some information, we can pose the following two questions: $(i)$ Is the information true? $(ii)$ If not, who initially spread that information? % The first problem is the rumor detection issue, while the second is the rumor source detection problem. A rumor-detection problem involves identifying and mitigating false or misleading information spread via various communication channels, particularly online platforms and social media. Rumors can range from harmless ones to deliberately misleading content aimed at deceiving or manipulating audiences. Detecting misinformation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of information ecosystems and preventing harmful effects such as the spread of false beliefs, polarization, and even societal harm. Therefore, it is very important to quickly distinguish such misinformation while simultaneously finding its source to block it from spreading on the network. However, most of the existing surveys have analyzed these two issues separately. In this work, we first survey the existing research on the rumor-detection and rumor source detection problems with joint detection approaches, simultaneously. % This survey deals with these two issues together so that their relationship can be observed and it provides how the two problems are similar and different. The limitations arising from the rumor detection, rumor source detection, and their combination problems are also explained, and some challenges to be addressed in future works are presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference of a Rumor's Source in the Independent Cascade Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.12125v1)** | 2022-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the so-called Independent Cascade Model for rumor spreading or epidemic processes popularized by Kempe et al.\ [2003]. In this model, a small subset of nodes from a network are the source of a rumor. In discrete time steps, each informed node "infects" each of its uninformed neighbors with probability $p$. While many facets of this process are studied in the literature, less is known about the inference problem: given a number of infected nodes in a network, can we learn the source of the rumor? In the context of epidemiology this problem is often referred to as patient zero problem. It belongs to a broader class of problems where the goal is to infer parameters of the underlying spreading model, see, e.g., Lokhov [NeurIPS'16] or Mastakouri et al. [NeurIPS'20]. In this work we present a maximum likelihood estimator for the rumor's source, given a snapshot of the process in terms of a set of active nodes $X$ after $t$ steps. Our results show that, for cycle-free graphs, the likelihood estimator undergoes a non-trivial phase transition as a function $t$. We provide a rigorous analysis for two prominent classes of acyclic network, namely $d$-regular trees and Galton-Watson trees, and verify empirically that our heuristics work well in various general networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rumor Source Detection under Querying with Untruthful Answers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.05496v5)** | 2020-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social networks are the major routes for most individuals to exchange their opinions about new products, social trends and political issues via their interactions. It is often of significant importance to figure out who initially diffuses the information, ie, finding a rumor source or a trend setter. It is known that such a task is highly challenging and the source detection probability cannot be beyond 31 percent for regular trees, if we just estimate the source from a given diffusion snapshot. In practice, finding the source often entails the process of querying that asks "Are you the rumor source?" or "Who tells you the rumor?" that would increase the chance of detecting the source. In this paper, we consider two kinds of querying: (a) simple batch querying and (b) interactive querying with direction under the assumption that queries can be untruthful with some probability. We propose estimation algorithms for those queries, and quantify their detection performance and the amount of extra budget due to untruthfulness, analytically showing that querying significantly improves the detection performance. We perform extensive simulations to validate our theoretical findings over synthetic and real-world social network topologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Schemes of Propagation Models and Source Estimators for Rumor Source Detection in Online Social Networks: A Short Survey of a Decade of Research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.00753v1)** | 2021-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen various rumor diffusion models being assumed in detection of rumor source research of the online social network. Diffusion model is arguably considered as a very important and challengeable factor for source detection in networks but it is less studied. This paper provides an overview of three representative schemes of Independent Cascade-based, Epidemic-based, and Learning-based to model the patterns of rumor propagation as well as three major schemes of estimators for rumor sources since its inception a decade ago.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Inference on Truth/Rumor and Their Sources in Social Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.08472v1)** | 2020-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the contemporary era of information explosion, we are often faced with the mixture of massive \emph{truth} (true information) and \emph{rumor} (false information) flooded over social networks. Under such circumstances, it is very essential to infer whether each claim (e.g., news, messages) is a truth or a rumor, and identify their \emph{sources}, i.e., the users who initially spread those claims. While most prior arts have been dedicated to the two tasks respectively, this paper aims to offer the joint inference on truth/rumor and their sources. Our insight is that a joint inference can enhance the mutual performance on both sides. To this end, we propose a framework named SourceCR, which alternates between two modules, i.e., \emph{credibility-reliability training} for truth/rumor inference and \emph{division-querying} for source detection, in an iterative manner. To elaborate, the former module performs a simultaneous estimation of claim credibility and user reliability by virtue of an Expectation Maximization algorithm, which takes the source reliability outputted from the latter module as the initial input. Meanwhile, the latter module divides the network into two different subnetworks labeled via the claim credibility, and in each subnetwork launches source detection by applying querying of theoretical budget guarantee to the users selected via the estimated reliability from the former module. The proposed SourceCR is provably convergent, and algorithmic implementable with reasonable computational complexity. We empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in both synthetic and real datasets, where the joint inference leads to an up to 35\% accuracy of credibility gain and 29\% source detection rate gain compared with the separate counterparts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification of Source of Rumors in Social Networks with Incomplete Information](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.00557v1)** | 2015-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rumor source identification in large social networks has received significant attention lately. Most recent works deal with the scale of the problem by observing a subset of the nodes in the network, called sensors, to estimate the source. This paper addresses the problem of locating the source of a rumor in large social networks where some of these sensor nodes have failed. We estimate the missing information about the sensors using doubly non-negative (DN) matrix completion and compressed sensing techniques. This is then used to identify the actual source by using a maximum likelihood estimator we developed earlier, on a large data set from Sina Weibo. Results indicate that the estimation techniques result in almost as good a performance of the ML estimator as for the network for which complete information is available. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work on source identification with incomplete information in social networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Rumor Sources Using Dominant Eigenvalue of Nonbacktracking Matrix](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00659v1)** | 2018-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of identifying rumor sources in a network, in which rumor spreading obeys a time-slotted susceptible-infected model. Unlike existing approaches, our proposed algorithm identifies as sources those nodes, which when set as sources, result in the smallest dominant eigenvalue of the corresponding reduced nonbacktracking matrix deduced from message passing equations. We also propose a reduced-complexity algorithm derived from the previous algorithm through a perturbation approximation. Numerical experiments on synthesized and real-world networks suggest that these proposed algorithms generally have higher accuracy compared with representative existing algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at GlobalSIP 2018</p></details> |
| **[On the Distance Between the Rumor Source and Its Optimal Estimate in a Regular Tree](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.03039v2)** | 2019-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the rumor source identification problem, where the goal is to find the origin node of a rumor in a network among a given set of nodes with the rumor. In this paper, we focus on a network represented by a regular tree which does not have any cycle and in which all nodes have the same number of edges connected to a node. For this network, we clarify that, with quite high probability, the origin node is within the distance 3 from the node selected by the optimal estimator, where the distance is the number of edges of the unique path connecting two nodes. This is clarified by the probability distribution of the distance between the origin and the selected node.</p></details> | <details><summary>fixed...</summary><p>fixed typos and proofs, 16 pages, 2 figures, a short version of this paper has been submitted to the 2019 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT 2019)</p></details> |
| **[Rumor source detection with multiple observations under adaptive diffusions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11211v1)** | 2020-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work, motivated by anonymous messaging platforms, has introduced adaptive diffusion protocols which can obfuscate the source of a rumor: a "snapshot adversary" with access to the subgraph of "infected" nodes can do no better than randomly guessing the entity of the source node. What happens if the adversary has access to multiple independent snapshots? We study this question when the underlying graph is the infinite $d$-regular tree. We show that (1) a weak form of source obfuscation is still possible in the case of two independent snapshots, but (2) already with three observations there is a simple algorithm that finds the rumor source with constant probability, regardless of the adaptive diffusion protocol. We also characterize the tradeoff between local spreading and source obfuscation for adaptive diffusion protocols (under a single snapshot). These results raise questions about the robustness of anonymity guarantees when spreading information in social networks.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Hiding the Rumor Source](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.02849v2)** | 2016-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anonymous social media platforms like Secret, Yik Yak, and Whisper have emerged as important tools for sharing ideas without the fear of judgment. Such anonymous platforms are also important in nations under authoritarian rule, where freedom of expression and the personal safety of message authors may depend on anonymity. Whether for fear of judgment or retribution, it is sometimes crucial to hide the identities of users who post sensitive messages. In this paper, we consider a global adversary who wishes to identify the author of a message; it observes either a snapshot of the spread of a message at a certain time, sampled timestamp metadata, or both. Recent advances in rumor source detection show that existing messaging protocols are vulnerable against such an adversary. We introduce a novel messaging protocol, which we call adaptive diffusion, and show that under the snapshot adversarial model, adaptive diffusion spreads content fast and achieves perfect obfuscation of the source when the underlying contact network is an infinite regular tree. That is, all users with the message are nearly equally likely to have been the origin of the message. When the contact network is an irregular tree, we characterize the probability of maximum likelihood detection by proving a concentration result over Galton-Watson trees. Experiments on a sampled Facebook network demonstrate that adaptive diffusion effectively hides the location of the source even when the graph is finite, irregular and has cycles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spy vs. Spy: Rumor Source Obfuscation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.8439v3)** | 2015-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anonymous messaging platforms, such as Secret and Whisper, have emerged as important social media for sharing one's thoughts without the fear of being judged by friends, family, or the public. Further, such anonymous platforms are crucial in nations with authoritarian governments; the right to free expression and sometimes the personal safety of the author of the message depend on anonymity. Whether for fear of judgment or personal endangerment, it is crucial to keep anonymous the identity of the user who initially posted a sensitive message. In this paper, we consider an adversary who observes a snapshot of the spread of a message at a certain time. Recent advances in rumor source detection shows that the existing messaging protocols are vulnerable against such an adversary. We introduce a novel messaging protocol, which we call adaptive diffusion, and show that it spreads the messages fast and achieves a perfect obfuscation of the source when the underlying contact network is an infinite regular tree: all users with the message are nearly equally likely to have been the origin of the message. Experiments on a sampled Facebook network show that it effectively hides the location of the source even when the graph is finite, irregular and has cycles. We further consider a stronger adversarial model where a subset of colluding users track the reception of messages. We show that the adaptive diffusion provides a strong protection of the anonymity of the source even under this scenario.</p></details> | 14 pages 10 figures |
| **[Rumors in a Network: Who's the Culprit?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.4370v2)** | 2010-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a systematic study of the problem of finding the source of a rumor in a network. We model rumor spreading in a network with a variant of the popular SIR model and then construct an estimator for the rumor source. This estimator is based upon a novel topological quantity which we term \textbf{rumor centrality}. We establish that this is an ML estimator for a class of graphs. We find the following surprising threshold phenomenon: on trees which grow faster than a line, the estimator always has non-trivial detection probability, whereas on trees that grow like a line, the detection probability will go to 0 as the network grows. Simulations performed on synthetic networks such as the popular small-world and scale-free networks, and on real networks such as an internet AS network and the U.S. electric power grid network, show that the estimator either finds the source exactly or within a few hops of the true source across different network topologies. We compare rumor centrality to another common network centrality notion known as distance centrality. We prove that on trees, the rumor center and distance center are equivalent, but on general networks, they may differ. Indeed, simulations show that rumor centrality outperforms distance centrality in finding rumor sources in networks which are not tree-like.</p></details> | 43 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Examining the Limitations of Computational Rumor Detection Models Trained on Static Datasets](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11576v2)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial aspect of a rumor detection model is its ability to generalize, particularly its ability to detect emerging, previously unknown rumors. Past research has indicated that content-based (i.e., using solely source posts as input) rumor detection models tend to perform less effectively on unseen rumors. At the same time, the potential of context-based models remains largely untapped. The main contribution of this paper is in the in-depth evaluation of the performance gap between content and context-based models specifically on detecting new, unseen rumors. Our empirical findings demonstrate that context-based models are still overly dependent on the information derived from the rumors' source post and tend to overlook the significant role that contextual information can play. We also study the effect of data split strategies on classifier performance. Based on our experimental results, the paper also offers practical suggestions on how to minimize the effects of temporal concept drift in static datasets during the training of rumor detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |
| **[Rumor Detection by Multi-task Suffix Learning based on Time-series Dual Sentiments](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.14383v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread dissemination of rumors on social media has a significant impact on people's lives, potentially leading to public panic and fear. Rumors often evoke specific sentiments, resonating with readers and prompting sharing. To effectively detect and track rumors, it is essential to observe the fine-grained sentiments of both source and response message pairs as the rumor evolves over time. However, current rumor detection methods fail to account for this aspect. In this paper, we propose MSuf, the first multi-task suffix learning framework for rumor detection and tracking using time series dual (coupled) sentiments. MSuf includes three modules: (1) an LLM to extract sentiment intensity features and sort them chronologically; (2) a module that fuses the sorted sentiment features with their source text word embeddings to obtain an aligned embedding; (3) two hard prompts are combined with the aligned vector to perform rumor detection and sentiment analysis using one frozen LLM. MSuf effectively enhances the performance of LLMs for rumor detection with only minimal parameter fine-tuning. Evaluating MSuf on four rumor detection benchmarks, we find significant improvements compared to other emotion-based methods.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Rumor Detection with Self-supervised Learning on Texts and Social Graph](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08838v1)** | 2022-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rumor detection has become an emerging and active research field in recent years. At the core is to model the rumor characteristics inherent in rich information, such as propagation patterns in social network and semantic patterns in post content, and differentiate them from the truth. However, existing works on rumor detection fall short in modeling heterogeneous information, either using one single information source only (e.g. social network, or post content) or ignoring the relations among multiple sources (e.g. fusing social and content features via simple concatenation). Therefore, they possibly have drawbacks in comprehensively understanding the rumors, and detecting them accurately. In this work, we explore contrastive self-supervised learning on heterogeneous information sources, so as to reveal their relations and characterize rumors better. Technically, we supplement the main supervised task of detection with an auxiliary self-supervised task, which enriches post representations via post self-discrimination. Specifically, given two heterogeneous views of a post (i.e. representations encoding social patterns and semantic patterns), the discrimination is done by maximizing the mutual information between different views of the same post compared to that of other posts. We devise cluster-wise and instance-wise approaches to generate the views and conduct the discrimination, considering different relations of information sources. We term this framework as Self-supervised Rumor Detection (SRD). Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of SRD for automatic rumor detection on social media.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Attention Networks for Early Detection of Rumors on Twitter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05866v1)** | 2020-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of mobile Internet technology and the widespread use of mobile devices, it becomes much easier for people to express their opinions on social media. The openness and convenience of social media platforms provide a free expression for people but also cause new social problems. The widespread of false rumors on social media can bring about the panic of the public and damage personal reputation, which makes rumor automatic detection technology become particularly necessary. The majority of existing methods for rumor detection focus on mining effective features from text contents, user profiles, and patterns of propagation. Nevertheless, these methods do not take full advantage of global semantic relations of the text contents, which characterize the semantic commonality of rumors as a key factor for detecting rumors. In this paper, we construct a tweet-word-user heterogeneous graph based on the text contents and the source tweet propagations of rumors. A meta-path based heterogeneous graph attention network framework is proposed to capture the global semantic relations of text contents, together with the global structure information of source tweet propagations for rumor detection. Experiments on real-world Twitter data demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach, which also has a comparable ability to detect rumors at a very early stage.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Detecting Rumor Veracity with Only Textual Information by Double-Channel Structure](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03195v1)** | 2023-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kyle (1985) proposes two types of rumors: informed rumors which are based on some private information and uninformed rumors which are not based on any information (i.e. bluffing). Also, prior studies find that when people have credible source of information, they are likely to use a more confident textual tone in their spreading of rumors. Motivated by these theoretical findings, we propose a double-channel structure to determine the ex-ante veracity of rumors on social media. Our ultimate goal is to classify each rumor into true, false, or unverifiable category. We first assign each text into either certain (informed rumor) or uncertain (uninformed rumor) category. Then, we apply lie detection algorithm to informed rumors and thread-reply agreement detection algorithm to uninformed rumors. Using the dataset of SemEval 2019 Task 7, which requires ex-ante threefold classification (true, false, or unverifiable) of social media rumors, our model yields a macro-F1 score of 0.4027, outperforming all the baseline models and the second-place winner (Gorrell et al., 2019). Furthermore, we empirically validate that the double-channel structure outperforms single-channel structures which use either lie detection or agreement detection algorithm to all posts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rumor Detection on Social Media with Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.06362v1)** | 2020-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media has been developing rapidly in public due to its nature of spreading new information, which leads to rumors being circulated. Meanwhile, detecting rumors from such massive information in social media is becoming an arduous challenge. Therefore, some deep learning methods are applied to discover rumors through the way they spread, such as Recursive Neural Network (RvNN) and so on. However, these deep learning methods only take into account the patterns of deep propagation but ignore the structures of wide dispersion in rumor detection. Actually, propagation and dispersion are two crucial characteristics of rumors. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-directional graph model, named Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks (Bi-GCN), to explore both characteristics by operating on both top-down and bottom-up propagation of rumors. It leverages a GCN with a top-down directed graph of rumor spreading to learn the patterns of rumor propagation, and a GCN with an opposite directed graph of rumor diffusion to capture the structures of rumor dispersion. Moreover, the information from the source post is involved in each layer of GCN to enhance the influences from the roots of rumors. Encouraging empirical results on several benchmarks confirm the superiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, AAAI 2020</p></details> |
| **[Neural Language Model Based Training Data Augmentation for Weakly Supervised Early Rumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.07033v1)** | 2019-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity and class imbalance of training data are known issues in current rumor detection tasks. We propose a straight-forward and general-purpose data augmentation technique which is beneficial to early rumor detection relying on event propagation patterns. The key idea is to exploit massive unlabeled event data sets on social media to augment limited labeled rumor source tweets. This work is based on rumor spreading patterns revealed by recent rumor studies and semantic relatedness between labeled and unlabeled data. A state-of-the-art neural language model (NLM) and large credibility-focused Twitter corpora are employed to learn context-sensitive representations of rumor tweets. Six different real-world events based on three publicly available rumor datasets are employed in our experiments to provide a comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of the method. The results show that our method can expand the size of an existing rumor data set nearly by 200% and corresponding social context (i.e., conversational threads) by 100% with reasonable quality. Preliminary experiments with a state-of-the-art deep learning-based rumor detection model show that augmented data can alleviate over-fitting and class imbalance caused by limited train data and can help to train complex neural networks (NNs). With augmented data, the performance of rumor detection can be improved by 12.1% in terms of F-score. Our experiments also indicate that augmented training data can help to generalize rumor detection models on unseen rumors.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[HRDE: Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models for Chinese Health Rumor Detection and Explainability](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00668v2)** | 2024-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As people increasingly prioritize their health, the speed and breadth of health information dissemination on the internet have also grown. At the same time, the presence of false health information (health rumors) intermingled with genuine content poses a significant potential threat to public health. However, current research on Chinese health rumors still lacks a large-scale, public, and open-source dataset of health rumor information, as well as effective and reliable rumor detection methods. This paper addresses this gap by constructing a dataset containing 1.12 million health-related rumors (HealthRCN) through web scraping of common health-related questions and a series of data processing steps. HealthRCN is the largest known dataset of Chinese health information rumors to date. Based on this dataset, we propose retrieval-augmented large language models for Chinese health rumor detection and explainability (HRDE). This model leverages retrieved relevant information to accurately determine whether the input health information is a rumor and provides explanatory responses, effectively aiding users in verifying the authenticity of health information. In evaluation experiments, we compared multiple models and found that HRDE outperformed them all, including GPT-4-1106-Preview, in rumor detection accuracy and answer quality. HRDE achieved an average accuracy of 91.04% and an F1 score of 91.58%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jointly embedding the local and global relations of heterogeneous graph for rumor detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04465v2)** | 2019-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of social media has revolutionized the way people communicate, share information and make decisions, but it also provides an ideal platform for publishing and spreading rumors. Existing rumor detection methods focus on finding clues from text content, user profiles, and propagation patterns. However, the local semantic relation and global structural information in the message propagation graph have not been well utilized by previous works. In this paper, we present a novel global-local attention network (GLAN) for rumor detection, which jointly encodes the local semantic and global structural information. We first generate a better integrated representation for each source tweet by fusing the semantic information of related retweets with the attention mechanism. Then, we model the global relationships among all source tweets, retweets, and users as a heterogeneous graph to capture the rich structural information for rumor detection. We conduct experiments on three real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that GLAN significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models in both rumor detection and early detection scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining 2019</p></details> |
| **[VGA: Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network for Rumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.01759v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of social media, rumors have been spread broadly on social media platforms, causing great harm to society. Beside textual information, many rumors also use manipulated images or conceal textual information within images to deceive people and avoid being detected, making multimodal rumor detection be a critical problem. The majority of multimodal rumor detection methods mainly concentrate on extracting features of source claims and their corresponding images, while ignoring the comments of rumors and their propagation structures. These comments and structures imply the wisdom of crowds and are proved to be crucial to debunk rumors. Moreover, these methods usually only extract visual features in a basic manner, seldom consider tampering or textual information in images. Therefore, in this study, we propose a novel Vision and Graph Fused Attention Network (VGA) for rumor detection to utilize propagation structures among posts so as to obtain the crowd opinions and further explore visual tampering features, as well as the textual information hidden in images. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets, demonstrating that VGA can effectively detect multimodal rumors and outperform state-of-the-art methods significantly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Region-enhanced Deep Graph Convolutional Networks for Rumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.07665v3)** | 2022-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media has been rapidly developing in the public sphere due to its ease of spreading new information, which leads to the circulation of rumors. However, detecting rumors from such a massive amount of information is becoming an increasingly arduous challenge. Previous work generally obtained valuable features from propagation information. It should be noted that most methods only target the propagation structure while ignoring the rumor transmission pattern. This limited focus severely restricts the collection of spread data. To solve this problem, the authors of the present study are motivated to explore the regionalized propagation patterns of rumors. Specifically, a novel region-enhanced deep graph convolutional network (RDGCN) that enhances the propagation features of rumors by learning regionalized propagation patterns and trains to learn the propagation patterns by unsupervised learning is proposed. In addition, a source-enhanced residual graph convolution layer (SRGCL) is designed to improve the graph neural network (GNN) oversmoothness and increase the depth limit of the rumor detection methods-based GNN. Experiments on Twitter15 and Twitter16 show that the proposed model performs better than the baseline approach on rumor detection and early rumor detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the error in the hyperparameter record during the repeated experiment, there are problems in reproducing the results</p></details> |
| **[Rumor Detection and Classification for Twitter Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.08926v1)** | 2019-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the pervasiveness of online media data as a source of information verifying the validity of this information is becoming even more important yet quite challenging. Rumors spread a large quantity of misinformation on microblogs. In this study we address two common issues within the context of microblog social media. First we detect rumors as a type of misinformation propagation and next we go beyond detection to perform the task of rumor classification. WE explore the problem using a standard data set. We devise novel features and study their impact on the task. We experiment with various levels of preprocessing as a precursor of the classification as well as grouping of features. We achieve and f-measure of over 0.82 in RDC task in mixed rumors data set and 84 percent in a single rumor data set using a two-step classification approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Cross-Domain Rumor Detection with Contrastive Learning and Cross-Attention](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11945v1)** | 2023-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Massive rumors usually appear along with breaking news or trending topics, seriously hindering the truth. Existing rumor detection methods are mostly focused on the same domain, and thus have poor performance in cross-domain scenarios due to domain shift. In this work, we propose an end-to-end instance-wise and prototype-wise contrastive learning model with a cross-attention mechanism for cross-domain rumor detection. The model not only performs cross-domain feature alignment but also enforces target samples to align with the corresponding prototypes of a given source domain. Since target labels in a target domain are unavailable, we use a clustering-based approach with carefully initialized centers by a batch of source domain samples to produce pseudo labels. Moreover, we use a cross-attention mechanism on a pair of source data and target data with the same labels to learn domain-invariant representations. Because the samples in a domain pair tend to express similar semantic patterns, especially on the people's attitudes (e.g., supporting or denying) towards the same category of rumors, the discrepancy between a pair of the source domain and target domain will be decreased.

With the a priori knowledge of suspect nodes and an observation of infected nodes, we construct a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to identify the rumor source using the susceptible-infected (SI) model. The a priori suspect set and its associated connectivity bring about new ingredients to the problem, and thus we propose to use local rumor center, a generalized concept based on rumor centrality, to identify the source from suspects. For regular tree-type networks of node degree δ, we characterize Pc(n), the correct detection probability of the estimator upon observing n infected nodes, in both the finite and asymptotic regimes. First, when every infected node is a suspect, Pc(n) asymptotically grows from 0.25 to 0.307 with δ from 3 to infinity, a result first established in Shah and Zaman (2011, 2012) via a different approach; and it monotonically decreases with n and increases with δ. Second, when the suspects form a connected subgraph of the network, Pc(n) asymptotically significantly exceeds the a priori probability if δ>2, and reliable detection is achieved as δ becomes large; furthermore, it monotonically decreases with n and increases with δ. Third, when there are only two suspects, Pc(n) is asymptotically at least 0.75 if δ>2; and it increases with the distance between the two suspects. Fourth, when there are multiple suspects, among all possible connection patterns, that they form a connected subgraph of the network achieves the smallest detection probability. Our analysis leverages ideas from the Polya's urn model in probability theory and sheds insight into the behavior of the rumor spreading process not only in the asymptotic regime but also for the general finite-n regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

Tweets from different sources pertaining to a rumor are processed on three levels: first, factuality values are assigned to each tweet based on four textual cue categories relevant for our journalism use case; these amalgamate speaker support in terms of polarity and commitment in terms of certainty and speculation. Next, the proportions of these lexical cues are utilized as predictors for tweet certainty in a generalized linear regression model. Subsequently, lexical cue proportions, predicted certainty, as well as their time course characteristics are used to compute veracity for each rumor in terms of the identity of the rumor-resolving tweet and its binary resolution value judgment. The system operates without access to extralinguistic resources. Evaluated on the data portion for which hand-labeled examples were available, it achieves .74 F1-score on identifying rumor resolving tweets and .76 F1-score on predicting if a rumor is resolved as true or false.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in: Proc. 2nd Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text, Osaka, Japan, 2016</p></details> |
| **[RP-DNN: A Tweet level propagation context based deep neural networks for early rumor detection in Social Media](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.12683v2)** | 2020-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early rumor detection (ERD) on social media platform is very challenging when limited, incomplete and noisy information is available. Most of the existing methods have largely worked on event-level detection that requires the collection of posts relevant to a specific event and relied only on user-generated content. They are not appropriate to detect rumor sources in the very early stages, before an event unfolds and becomes widespread. In this paper, we address the task of ERD at the message level. We present a novel hybrid neural network architecture, which combines a task-specific character-based bidirectional language model and stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to represent textual contents and social-temporal contexts of input source tweets, for modelling propagation patterns of rumors in the early stages of their development. We apply multi-layered attention models to jointly learn attentive context embeddings over multiple context inputs. Our experiments employ a stringent leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) evaluation setup on seven publicly available real-life rumor event data sets. Our models achieve state-of-the-art(SoA) performance for detecting unseen rumors on large augmented data which covers more than 12 events and 2,967 rumors. An ablation study is conducted to understand the relative contribution of each component of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted for publication at The LREC 2020 Proceedings.

However, none of these studies exploited evidence from trusted authorities. In this paper, we define the task of detecting the stance of authorities towards rumors in tweets, i.e., whether a tweet from an authority agrees, disagrees, or is unrelated to the rumor. We believe the task is useful to augment the sources of evidence utilized by existing rumor verification systems. We construct and release the first Authority STance towards Rumors (AuSTR) dataset, where evidence is retrieved from authority timelines in Arabic Twitter. Due to the relatively limited size of our dataset, we study the usefulness of existing datasets for stance detection in our task. We show that existing datasets are somewhat useful for the task; however, they are clearly insufficient, which motivates the need to augment them with annotated data constituting stance of authorities from Twitter.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was accepted at the 45th European Conference on Information Retrieval (ECIR 2023)</p></details> |
| **[Moral Emotions Shape the Virality of COVID-19 Misinformation on Social Media](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.03590v1)** | 2022-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While false rumors pose a threat to the successful overcoming of the COVID-19 pandemic, an understanding of how rumors diffuse in online social networks is - even for non-crisis situations - still in its infancy. Here we analyze a large sample consisting of COVID-19 rumor cascades from Twitter that have been fact-checked by third-party organizations. The data comprises N=10,610 rumor cascades that have been retweeted more than 24 million times. We investigate whether COVID-19 misinformation spreads more viral than the truth and whether the differences in the diffusion of true vs. false rumors can be explained by the moral emotions they carry. We observe that, on average, COVID-19 misinformation is more likely to go viral than truthful information. However, the veracity effect is moderated by moral emotions: false rumors are more viral than the truth if the source tweets embed a high number of other-condemning emotion words, whereas a higher number of self-conscious emotion words is linked to a less viral spread. The effects are pronounced both for health misinformation and false political rumors. These findings offer insights into how true vs. false rumors spread and highlight the importance of considering emotions from the moral emotion families in social media content.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rumor Detection with a novel graph neural network approach](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16206v3)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The wide spread of rumors on social media has caused a negative impact on people's daily life, leading to potential panic, fear, and mental health problems for the public. How to debunk rumors as early as possible remains a challenging problem. Existing studies mainly leverage information propagation structure to detect rumors, while very few works focus on correlation among users that they may coordinate to spread rumors in order to gain large popularity. In this paper, we propose a new detection model, that jointly learns both the representations of user correlation and information propagation to detect rumors on social media. Specifically, we leverage graph neural networks to learn the representations of user correlation from a bipartite graph that describes the correlations between users and source tweets, and the representations of information propagation with a tree structure. Then we combine the learned representations from these two modules to classify the rumors. Since malicious users intend to subvert our model after deployment, we further develop a greedy attack scheme to analyze the cost of three adversarial attacks: graph attack, comment attack, and joint attack. Evaluation results on two public datasets illustrate that the proposed MODEL outperforms the state-of-the-art rumor detection models. We also demonstrate our method performs well for early rumor detection. Moreover, the proposed detection method is more robust to adversarial attacks compared to the best existing method. Importantly, we show that it requires a high cost for attackers to subvert user correlation pattern, demonstrating the importance of considering user correlation for rumor detection.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Investigating Rumor Propagation with TwitterTrails](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.3550v1)** | 2014-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media have become part of modern news reporting, used by journalists to spread information and find sources, or as a news source by individuals. The quest for prominence and recognition on social media sites like Twitter can sometimes eclipse accuracy and lead to the spread of false information. As a way to study and react to this trend, we introduce {\sc TwitterTrails}, an interactive, web-based tool ({\tt twittertrails.com}) that allows users to investigate the origin and propagation characteristics of a rumor and its refutation, if any, on Twitter. Visualizations of burst activity, propagation timeline, retweet and co-retweeted networks help its users trace the spread of a story. Within minutes {\sc TwitterTrails} will collect relevant tweets and automatically answer several important questions regarding a rumor: its originator, burst characteristics, propagators and main actors according to the audience. In addition, it will compute and report the rumor's level of visibility and, as an example of the power of crowdsourcing, the audience's skepticism towards it which correlates with the rumor's credibility. We envision {\sc TwitterTrails} as valuable tool for individual use, but we especially for amateur and professional journalists investigating recent and breaking stories. Further, its expanding collection of investigated rumors can be used to answer questions regarding the amount and success of misinformation on Twitter.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> |

Despite being widely used, we find that these datasets suffer from spurious correlations, which are ignored by existing studies and lead to severe overestimation of existing rumor detection performance. The spurious correlations stem from three causes: (1) event-based data collection and labeling schemes assign the same veracity label to multiple highly similar posts from the same underlying event; (2) merging multiple data sources spuriously relates source identities to veracity labels; and (3) labeling bias. In this paper, we closely investigate three of the most popular rumor detection benchmark datasets (i.e., Twitter15, Twitter16 and PHEME), and propose event-separated rumor detection as a solution to eliminate spurious cues. Under the event-separated setting, we observe that the accuracy of existing state-of-the-art models drops significantly by over 40%, becoming only comparable to a simple neural classifier. To better address this task, we propose Publisher Style Aggregation (PSA), a generalizable approach that aggregates publisher posting records to learn writing style and veracity stance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines in terms of effectiveness, efficiency and generalizability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECML-PKDD 2022</p></details> |
| **[Propagation Dynamics of Rumor vs. Non-rumor across Multiple Social Media Platforms Driven by User Characteristics](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.17840v1)** | 2024-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studying information propagation dynamics in social media can elucidate user behaviors and patterns. However, previous research often focuses on single platforms and fails to differentiate between the nuanced roles of source users and other participants in cascades. To address these limitations, we analyze propagation cascades on Twitter and Weibo combined with a crawled dataset of nearly one million users with authentic attributes. Our preliminary findings from multiple platforms robustly indicate that rumors tend to spread more deeply, while non-rumors distribute more broadly. Interestingly, we discover that the spread of rumors is slower, persists longer, and, in most cases, involves fewer participants than that of non-rumors. And an undiscovered highlight is that reputable active users, termed `onlookers', inadvertently or unwittingly spread rumors due to their extensive online interactions and the allure of sensational fake news. Conversely, celebrities exhibit caution, mindful of releasing unverified information. Additionally, we identify cascade features aligning with exponential patterns, highlight the Credibility Erosion Effect (CEE) phenomenon in the propagation process, and discover the different contents and policies between the two platforms. Our findings enhance current understanding and provide a valuable statistical analysis for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Automated Fact Checking Using External Sources](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.00341v1)** | 2017-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the constantly growing proliferation of false claims online in recent years, there has been also a growing research interest in automatically distinguishing false rumors from factually true claims. Here, we propose a general-purpose framework for fully-automatic fact checking using external sources, tapping the potential of the entire Web as a knowledge source to confirm or reject a claim. Our framework uses a deep neural network with LSTM text encoding to combine semantic kernels with task-specific embeddings that encode a claim together with pieces of potentially-relevant text fragments from the Web, taking the source reliability into account. The evaluation results show good performance on two different tasks and datasets: (i) rumor detection and (ii) fact checking of the answers to a question in community question answering forums.</p></details> | RANLP-2017 |

Although recent solutions have enhanced performance by leveraging deep neural networks, they often require complete user data. In this paper, we address a more challenging task, rumor source detection with incomplete user data, and propose a novel framework, i.e., Source Detection in Graphs with Incomplete Nodes via Positional Encoding and Attentive Fusion (GIN-SD), to tackle this challenge. Specifically, our approach utilizes a positional embedding module to distinguish nodes that are incomplete and employs a self-attention mechanism to focus on nodes with greater information transmission capacity. To mitigate the prediction bias caused by the significant disparity between the numbers of source and non-source nodes, we also introduce a class-balancing mechanism. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of GIN-SD and its superiority to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by AAAI24</p></details> |
| **[An Information Diffusion Approach to Rumor Propagation and Identification on Twitter](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11104v1)** | 2020-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing use of online social networks as a source of news and information, the propensity for a rumor to disseminate widely and quickly poses a great concern, especially in disaster situations where users do not have enough time to fact-check posts before making the informed decision to react to a post that appears to be credible. In this study, we explore the propagation pattern of rumors on Twitter by exploring the dynamics of microscopic-level misinformation spread, based on the latent message and user interaction attributes. We perform supervised learning for feature selection and prediction. Experimental results with real-world data sets give the models' prediction accuracy at about 90\% for the diffusion of both True and False topics. Our findings confirm that rumor cascades run deeper and that rumor masked as news, and messages that incite fear, will diffuse faster than other messages. We show that the models for True and False message propagation differ significantly, both in the prediction parameters and in the message features that govern the diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion pattern is an important metric in identifying the credibility of a tweet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Epidemiology-informed Network for Robust Rumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12949v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid spread of rumors on social media has posed significant challenges to maintaining public trust and information integrity. Since an information cascade process is essentially a propagation tree, recent rumor detection models leverage graph neural networks to additionally capture information propagation patterns, thus outperforming text-only solutions. Given the variations in topics and social impact of the root node, different source information naturally has distinct outreach capabilities, resulting in different heights of propagation trees. This variation, however, impedes the data-driven design of existing graph-based rumor detectors. Given a shallow propagation tree with limited interactions, it is unlikely for graph-based approaches to capture sufficient cascading patterns, questioning their ability to handle less popular news or early detection needs. In contrast, a deep propagation tree is prone to noisy user responses, and this can in turn obfuscate the predictions. In this paper, we propose a novel Epidemiology-informed Network (EIN) that integrates epidemiological knowledge to enhance performance by overcoming data-driven methods sensitivity to data quality. Meanwhile, to adapt epidemiology theory to rumor detection, it is expected that each users stance toward the source information will be annotated. To bypass the costly and time-consuming human labeling process, we take advantage of large language models to generate stance labels, facilitating optimization objectives for learning epidemiology-informed representations. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed EIN not only outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real-world datasets but also exhibits enhanced robustness across varying tree depths.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2025 (WWW2025)</p></details> |
| **[Multimodal Short Video Rumor Detection System Based on Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08401v3)** | 2023-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of short video platforms as prominent channels for news dissemination, major platforms in China have gradually evolved into fertile grounds for the proliferation of fake news. However, distinguishing short video rumors poses a significant challenge due to the substantial amount of information and shared features among videos, resulting in homogeneity. To address the dissemination of short video rumors effectively, our research group proposes a methodology encompassing multimodal feature fusion and the integration of external knowledge, considering the merits and drawbacks of each algorithm. The proposed detection approach entails the following steps: (1) creation of a comprehensive dataset comprising multiple features extracted from short videos; (2) development of a multimodal rumor detection model: first, we employ the Temporal Segment Networks (TSN) video coding model to extract video features, followed by the utilization of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) to extract textual features. Subsequently, the BERT model is employed to fuse textual and video features; (3) distinction is achieved through contrast learning: we acquire external knowledge by crawling relevant sources and leverage a vector database to incorporate this knowledge into the classification output. Our research process is driven by practical considerations, and the knowledge derived from this study will hold significant value in practical scenarios, such as short video rumor identification and the management of social opinions.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches in rumor source detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study, we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion. Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach, showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI25 |

The widespread presence of a heterogeneous mass of information sources may affect the mechanisms behind the formation of public opinion. Such a scenario is a florid environment for digital wildfires when combined with functional illiteracy, information overload, and confirmation bias. In this essay, we focus on a collection of works aiming at providing quantitative evidence about the cognitive determinants behind misinformation and rumor spreading. We account for users' behavior with respect to two distinct narratives: a) conspiracy and b) scientific information sources. In particular, we analyze Facebook data on a time span of five years in both the Italian and the US context, and measure users' response to i) information consistent with one's narrative, ii) troll contents, and iii) dissenting information e.g., debunking attempts. Our findings suggest that users tend to a) join polarized communities sharing a common narrative (echo chambers), b) acquire information confirming their beliefs (confirmation bias) even if containing false claims, and c) ignore dissenting information.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in machine learning-based methods, many fail to capture intrinsic dynamics of rumor propagation. In this work, we present SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in Sequential Hypergraphs, which harnesses the recent success of the state space model Mamba, known for its superior global modeling capabilities and computational efficiency, to address this challenge. Specifically, we first employ hypergraphs to model high-order interactions within social networks. Subsequently, temporal network snapshots generated during the propagation process are sequentially fed in reverse order into Mamba to infer underlying propagation dynamics. Finally, to empower the sequential model to effectively capture propagation patterns while integrating structural information, we propose a novel graph-aware state update mechanism, wherein the state of each node is propagated and refined by both temporal dependencies and topological context. Extensive evaluations on eight datasets demonstrate that SourceDetMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI25 |

Therefore, tools for investigating rumor news have become an urgent necessity. One useful function of such tools is to see ways a specific topic or event is represented by presenting different points of view from multiple sources. In this paper, we propose Maester, a novel agreement-aware search framework for investigating rumor news. Given an investigative question, Maester will retrieve related articles to that question, assign and display top articles from agree, disagree, and discuss categories to users. Splitting the results into these three categories provides the user a holistic view towards the investigative question. We build Maester based on the following two key observations: (1) relatedness can commonly be determined by keywords and entities occurring in both questions and articles, and (2) the level of agreement between the investigative question and the related news article can often be decided by a few key sentences. Accordingly, we use gradient boosting tree models with keyword/entity matching features for relatedness detection, and leverage recurrent neural network to infer the level of agreement. Our experiments on the Fake News Challenge (FNC) dataset demonstrate up to an order of magnitude improvement of Maester over the original FNC winning solution, for agreement-aware search.</p></details> |  |

The localization is done using the infection state and time of infection of a few designated sensor nodes; however, maintaining sensors can be very costly in practice. We propose the first online approach to source localization: We deploy a priori only a small number of sensors (which reveal if they are reached by an infection) and then iteratively choose the best location to place new sensors in order to localize the source. This approach allows for source localization with a very small number of sensors; moreover, the source can be found while the epidemic is still ongoing.

This shift in public behavior has opened doors for some to diffuse fake news on social media; and subsequently cause negative economic, political, and social consequences as well as distrust among the public. There are many proposed methods to solve the rumor detection problem, most of which do not take full advantage of the heterogeneous nature of news propagation networks. With this intention, we considered a previously proposed architecture as our baseline and performed the idea of structural feature extraction from the heterogeneous rumor propagation over its architecture using the concept of meta path-based embeddings. We named our model Meta Path-based Global Local Attention Network (MGLAN).

In this study, we examine to what extent Twitter's content recommender, in conjunction with a user's social network, impacts the topic, political skew, and reliability of information served on the platform during a high-stakes election. We utilize automated accounts to document Twitter's algorithmically curated and reverse chronological timelines throughout the U.S. 2022 midterm election. We find that the algorithmic timeline measurably influences exposure to election content, partisan skew, and the prevalence of low-quality information and election rumors. Critically, these impacts are mediated by the partisan makeup of one's personal social network, which often exerts greater influence than the algorithm alone. We find that the algorithmic feed decreases the proportion of election content shown to left-leaning accounts, and that it skews content toward right-leaning sources when compared to the reverse chronological feed. We additionally find evidence that the algorithmic system increases the prevalence of election-related rumors for right-leaning accounts, and has mixed effects on the prevalence of low-quality information sources. Our work provides insight into the outcomes of Twitter's complex recommender system at a crucial time period before controversial changes to the platform and in the midst of nationwide elections and highlights the need for ongoing study of algorithmic systems and their role in democratic processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AAAI International Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM) 2026</p></details> |

The challenge lies in tracing the source from a snapshot observation of infected nodes. How do we accurately pinpoint the source? Utilizing snapshot data, we apply a probabilistic approach, focusing on the graph boundary and the observed time, to detect sources via an effective maximum likelihood algorithm. A novel starlike tree approximation extends applicability to general graphs, demonstrating versatility. Unlike previous works that rely heavily on structural properties alone, our method also incorporates temporal data for more precise source detection. We highlight the utility of the Gamma function for analyzing the ratio of the likelihood being the source between nodes asymptotically. Comprehensive evaluations confirm algorithmic effectiveness in diverse network scenarios, advancing source detection in large-scale network analysis and information dissemination strategies.</p></details> |  |

Whether this happens through the diffusion of rumors, opinions, or viruses, identifying the diffusion source (i.e., the person that initiated it) is a problem that has attracted much research interest. Nevertheless, existing literature has ignored the possibility that the source might strategically modify the network structure (by rewiring links or introducing fake nodes) to escape detection. Here, without restricting our analysis to any particular diffusion scenario, we close this gap by evaluating two mechanisms that hide the source-one stemming from the source's actions, the other from the network structure itself. This reveals that sources can easily escape detection, and that removing links is far more effective than introducing fake nodes. Thus, efforts should focus on exposing concealed ties rather than planted entities; such exposure would drastically improve our chances of detecting the diffusion source.</p></details> | <details><summary>100 p...</summary><p>100 pages, 80 figures</p></details> |
| **[Limits for Rumor Spreading in stochastic populations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.08507v1)** | 2017-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological systems can share and collectively process information to yield emergent effects, despite inherent noise in communication. While man-made systems often employ intricate structural solutions to overcome noise, the structure of many biological systems is more amorphous. It is not well understood how communication noise may affect the computational repertoire of such groups. To approach this question we consider the basic collective task of rumor spreading, in which information from few knowledgeable sources must reliably flow into the rest of the population. In order to study the effect of communication noise on the ability of groups that lack stable structures to efficiently solve this task, we consider a noisy version of the uniform PULL model. We prove a lower bound which implies that, in the presence of even moderate levels of noise that affect all facets of the communication, no scheme can significantly outperform the trivial one in which agents have to wait until directly interacting with the sources. Our results thus show an exponential separation between the uniform PUSH and PULL communication models in the presence of noise. Such separation may be interpreted as suggesting that, in order to achieve efficient rumor spreading, a system must exhibit either some degree of structural stability or, alternatively, some facet of the communication which is immune to noise. We corroborate our theoretical findings with a new analysis of experimental data regarding recruitment in Cataglyphis niger desert ants.</p></details> |  |

We analyze engagement and interest in the COVID-19 topic and provide a differential assessment on the evolution of the discourse on a global scale for each platform and their users. We fit information spreading with epidemic models characterizing the basic reproduction numbers $R_0$ for each social media platform. Moreover, we characterize information spreading from questionable sources, finding different volumes of misinformation in each platform. However, information from both reliable and questionable sources do not present different spreading patterns. Finally, we provide platform-dependent numerical estimates of rumors' amplification.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Identify an Infection Source with Limited Observations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.4161v2)** | 2014-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A rumor spreading in a social network or a disease propagating in a community can be modeled as an infection spreading in a network. Finding the infection source is a challenging problem, which is made more difficult in many applications where we have access only to a limited set of observations. We consider the problem of estimating an infection source for a Susceptible-Infected model, in which not all infected nodes can be observed. When the network is a tree, we show that an estimator for the source node associated with the most likely infection path that yields the limited observations is given by a Jordan center, i.e., a node with minimum distance to the set of observed infected nodes. We also propose approximate source estimators for general networks. Simulation results on various synthetic networks and real world networks suggest that our estimators perform better than distance, closeness, and betweenness centrality based heuristics.</p></details> |  |

This false news creates big damage to society and misleads people. For Example, in 2019, there was a rumor that the Padma Bridge of Bangladesh needed 100,000 human heads for sacrifice. This rumor turns into a deadly position and this misleading information takes the lives of innocent people. There is a lot of work in English but a few works in Bangla. In this study, we are going to identify the fake news from the unconsidered news source to provide the newsreader with natural news or real news. The paper is based on the combination of convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), where CNN is used for deep feature extraction and LSTM is used for detection using the extracted feature. The first thing we did to deploy this piece of work was data collection. We compiled a data set from websites and attempted to deploy it using the methodology of deep learning which contains about 50k of news. With the proposed model of Multichannel combined CNN-LSTM architecture, our model gained an accuracy of 75.05%, which is a good sign for detecting fake news in Bangla.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.

As real-world events and emergencies unfold, Twitter is abuzz with hundreds of thousands of stories about the events. Some of these stories are harmless, while others could potentially be life-saving or sources of malicious rumors. Thus, it is critically important to be able to efficiently track stories that spread on Twitter during these events. In this paper, we present a novel semi-automatic tool that enables users to efficiently identify and track stories about real-world events on Twitter. We ran a user study with 25 participants, demonstrating that compared to more conventional methods, our tool can increase the speed and the accuracy with which users can track stories about real-world events.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICWSM...</summary><p>ICWSM'16, May 17-20, Cologne, Germany.

Specifically, the search engine assists the information dissemination for social networks, i.e., enabling users to access interested contents with keywords-searching and promoting the process of contents-transferring from the source users directly to potential interested users. Accompanying such processes, the social network evolves as new links emerge between users with common interests. However, there is no clear understanding of such a "chicken-and-egg" problem, namely, new links encourage more social interactions, and vice versa. In this paper, we aim to quantitatively characterize the social network evolution phenomenon driven by a search engine. First, we propose a search network model for social network evolution. Second, we adopt two performance metrics, namely, degree distribution and network diameter. Theoretically, we prove that the degree distribution follows an intensified power-law, and the network diameter shrinks. Third, we quantitatively show that the search engine accelerates the rumor propagation in social networks. Finally, based on four real-world data sets (i.e., CDBLP, Facebook, Weibo Tweets, P2P), we verify our theoretical findings. Furthermore, we find that the search engine dramatically increases the speed of rumor propagation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Identifying Infection Sources and Regions in Large Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1204.0354v2)** | 2015-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the infection sources in a network, including the index cases that introduce a contagious disease into a population network, the servers that inject a computer virus into a computer network, or the individuals who started a rumor in a social network, plays a critical role in limiting the damage caused by the infection through timely quarantine of the sources. We consider the problem of estimating the infection sources and the infection regions (subsets of nodes infected by each source) in a network, based only on knowledge of which nodes are infected and their connections, and when the number of sources is unknown a priori. We derive estimators for the infection sources and their infection regions based on approximations of the infection sequences count. We prove that if there are at most two infection sources in a geometric tree, our estimator identifies the true source or sources with probability going to one as the number of infected nodes increases. When there are more than two infection sources, and when the maximum possible number of infection sources is known, we propose an algorithm with quadratic complexity to estimate the actual number and identities of the infection sources. Simulations on various kinds of networks, including tree networks, small-world networks and real world power grid networks, and tests on two real data sets are provided to verify the performance of our estimators.</p></details> |  |

It is important for policy makers and many people to identify types of shared tweets to better understand public behavior, topics of interest, requests from governments, sources of tweets, etc. It is also crucial to prevent spreading of rumors and misinformation about the virus or bad cures. To this end, we present the largest manually annotated dataset of Arabic tweets related to COVID-19. We describe annotation guidelines, analyze our dataset and build effective machine learning and transformer based models for classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infection Spreading and Source Identification: A Hide and Seek Game](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.04796v2)** | 2016-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of an infection source node (e.g., a rumor or computer virus source) in a network is to spread its infection to as many nodes as possible, while remaining hidden from the network administrator. On the other hand, the network administrator aims to identify the source node based on knowledge of which nodes have been infected. We model the infection spreading and source identification problem as a strategic game, where the infection source and the network administrator are the two players. As the Jordan center estimator is a minimax source estimator that has been shown to be robust in recent works, we assume that the network administrator utilizes a source estimation strategy that can probe any nodes within a given radius of the Jordan center. Given any estimation strategy, we design a best-response infection strategy for the source. Given any infection strategy, we design a best-response estimation strategy for the network administrator. We derive conditions under which a Nash equilibrium of the strategic game exists. Simulations in both synthetic and real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed infection strategy infects more nodes while maintaining the same safety margin between the true source node and the Jordan center source estimator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Source Identification on Networks with Statistical Confidence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.04800v2)** | 2021-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion source identification on networks is a problem of fundamental importance in a broad class of applications, including rumor controlling and virus identification. Though this problem has received significant recent attention, most studies have focused only on very restrictive settings and lack theoretical guarantees for more realistic networks. We introduce a statistical framework for the study of diffusion source identification and develop a confidence set inference approach inspired by hypothesis testing. Our method efficiently produces a small subset of nodes, which provably covers the source node with any pre-specified confidence level without restrictive assumptions on network structures. Moreover, we propose multiple Monte Carlo strategies for the inference procedure based on network topology and the probabilistic properties that significantly improve the scalability. To our knowledge, this is the first diffusion source identification method with a practically useful theoretical guarantee on general networks. We demonstrate our approach via extensive synthetic experiments on well-known random network models and a mobility network between cities concerning the COVID-19 spreading.</p></details> |  |

Recent examples include the premature Steve Jobs obituary, the second bankruptcy of United airlines, the creation of Black Holes by the operation of the Large Hadron Collider, etc. Since it is important to permit the expression of dissenting and conflicting opinions, it would be a fallacy to try to ensure that the Web provides only consistent information. However, to help in separating the wheat from the chaff, it is essential to be able to determine dependence between sources. Given the huge number of data sources and the vast volume of conflicting data available on the Web, doing so in a scalable manner is extremely challenging and has not been addressed by existing work yet. In this paper, we present a set of research problems and propose some preliminary solutions on the issues involved in discovering dependence between sources. We also discuss how this knowledge can benefit a variety of technologies, such as data integration and Web 2.0, that help users manage and access the totality of the available information from various sources.</p></details> | CIDR 2009 |
| **[Locating the source of diffusion in complex networks by time-reversal backward spreading](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.06133v2)** | 2016-11-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating the source that triggers a dynamical process is a fundamental but challenging problem in complex networks, ranging from epidemic spreading in society and on the Internet to cancer metastasis in the human body. An accurate localization of the source is inherently limited by our ability to simultaneously access the information of all nodes in a large-scale complex network. This thus raises two critical questions: how do we locate the source from incomplete information and can we achieve full localization of sources at any possible location from a given set of observable nodes. Here we develop a time-reversal backward spreading algorithm to locate the source of a diffusion-like process efficiently and propose a general locatability condition. We test the algorithm by employing epidemic spreading and consensus dynamics as typical dynamical processes and apply it to the H1N1 pandemic in China. We find that the sources can be precisely located in arbitrary networks insofar as the locatability condition is assured. Our tools greatly improve our ability to locate the source of diffusion in complex networks based on limited accessibility of nodal information. Moreover, they have implications for controlling a variety of dynamical processes taking place on complex networks, such as inhibiting epidemics, slowing the spread of rumors, pollution control and environmental protection.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Although it is widely acknowledged that random and local gossip communications make source identification difficult, there exists no general quantification of the level of anonymity provided to the source. This paper presents a principled method based on $\varepsilon$-differential privacy to analyze the inherent source anonymity of gossiping for a large class of graphs. First, we quantify the fundamental limit of source anonymity any gossip protocol can guarantee in an arbitrary communication graph. In particular, our result indicates that when the graph has poor connectivity, no gossip protocol can guarantee any meaningful level of differential privacy. This prompted us to further analyze graphs with controlled connectivity. We prove on these graphs that a large class of gossip protocols, namely cobra walks, offers tangible differential privacy guarantees to the source. In doing so, we introduce an original proof technique based on the reduction of a gossip protocol to what we call a random walk with probabilistic die out. This proof technique is of independent interest to the gossip community and readily extends to other protocols inherited from the security community, such as the Dandelion protocol. Interestingly, our tight analysis precisely captures the trade-off between dissemination time of a gossip protocol and its source anonymity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of DISC2023 paper</p></details> |
| **[Multiple Infection Sources Identification with Provable Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1608.06492v1)** | 2016-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given an aftermath of a cascade in the network, i.e. a set $V_I$ of "infected" nodes after an epidemic outbreak or a propagation of rumors/worms/viruses, how can we infer the sources of the cascade? Answering this challenging question is critical for computer forensic, vulnerability analysis, and risk management. Despite recent interest towards this problem, most of existing works focus only on single source detection or simple network topologies, e.g. trees or grids. In this paper, we propose a new approach to identify infection sources by searching for a seed set $S$ that minimizes the \emph{symmetric difference} between the cascade from $S$ and $V_I$, the given set of infected nodes. Our major result is an approximation algorithm, called SISI, to identify infection sources \emph{without the prior knowledge on the number of source nodes}. SISI, to our best knowledge, is the first algorithm with \emph{provable guarantee} for the problem in general graphs. It returns a $\frac{2}{(1-ε)^2}Δ$-approximate solution with high probability, where $Δ$ denotes the maximum number of nodes in $V_I$ that may infect a single node in the network. Our experiments on real-world networks show the superiority of our approach and SISI in detecting true source(s), boosting the F1-measure from few percents, for the state-of-the-art NETSLEUTH, to approximately 50\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>in Th...</summary><p>in The 25th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2016)</p></details> |

Our model also includes two new parameterized generalizations: (1) the network topology can undergo a bounded rate of change (for a parameterized rate that spans from no changes to changes in every round); and (2) in each round, each node can advertise a bounded amount of information to all of its neighbors before connection decisions are made (for a parameterized number of bits that spans from no advertisement to large advertisements). We prove that in the mobile telephone model with no advertisements and no topology changes, PUSH-PULL style algorithms perform poorly with respect to a graph's vertex expansion and graph conductance as compared to the known tight results in the classical telephone model. We then prove, however, that if nodes are allowed to advertise a single bit in each round, a natural variation of PUSH-PULL terminates in time that matches (within logarithmic factors) this strategy's performance in the classical telephone model---even in the presence of frequent topology changes. We also analyze how the performance of this algorithm degrades as the rate of change increases toward the maximum possible amount. We argue that our model matches well the properties of emerging peer-to-peer communication standards for mobile devices, and that our efficient PUSH-PULL variation that leverages small advertisements and adapts well to topology changes is a good choice for rumor spreading in this increasingly important setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended abstract to appear at the 2016 International Symposium on Distributed Computing (DISC 2016)</p></details> |
| **[Source Localization of Graph Diffusion via Variational Autoencoders for Graph Inverse Problems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12327v1)** | 2022-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph diffusion problems such as the propagation of rumors, computer viruses, or smart grid failures are ubiquitous and societal. Hence it is usually crucial to identify diffusion sources according to the current graph diffusion observations. Despite its tremendous necessity and significance in practice, source localization, as the inverse problem of graph diffusion, is extremely challenging as it is ill-posed: different sources may lead to the same graph diffusion patterns. Different from most traditional source localization methods, this paper focuses on a probabilistic manner to account for the uncertainty of different candidate sources. Such endeavors require overcoming challenges including 1) the uncertainty in graph diffusion source localization is hard to be quantified; 2) the complex patterns of the graph diffusion sources are difficult to be probabilistically characterized; 3) the generalization under any underlying diffusion patterns is hard to be imposed. To solve the above challenges, this paper presents a generic framework: Source Localization Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) for locating the diffusion sources under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Particularly, we propose a probabilistic model that leverages the forward diffusion estimation model along with deep generative models to approximate the diffusion source distribution for quantifying the uncertainty. SL-VAE further utilizes prior knowledge of the source-observation pairs to characterize the complex patterns of diffusion sources by a learned generative prior. Lastly, a unified objective that integrates the forward diffusion estimation model is derived to enforce the model to generalize under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted on 7 real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SL-VAE in reconstructing the diffusion sources by excelling other methods on average 20% in AUC score.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, accepted by SIGKDD 2022</p></details> |

In this large-scale study of news in social media we analyze eleven million posts and investigate propagation behavior of users that directly interact with news accounts identified as spreading trusted versus malicious content. Unlike previous work, which looks at specific rumors, topics, or events, we consider all content propagated by various news sources. Moreover, we analyze and contrast population versus sub-population behaviour (by demographics) when spreading misinformation, and distinguish between two types of propagation, i.e., direct retweets and mentions. Our evaluation examines how evenly, how many, how quickly, and which users propagate content from various types of news sources on Twitter. Our analysis has identified several key differences in propagation behavior from trusted versus suspicious news sources. These include high inequity in the diffusion rate based on the source of disinformation, with a small group of highly active users responsible for the majority of disinformation spread overall and within each demographic. Analysis by demographics showed that users with lower annual income and education share more from disinformation sources compared to their counterparts. News content is shared significantly more quickly from trusted, conspiracy, and disinformation sources compared to clickbait and propaganda. Older users propagate news from trusted sources more quickly than younger users, but they share from suspicious sources after longer delays. Finally, users who interact with clickbait and conspiracy sources are likely to share from propaganda accounts, but not the other way around.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables, published in IEEE TCSS December 2018</p></details> |

Its underlying protocol defines how transactions and blocks are distributed through all participating nodes. To protect user privacy, the identity of the node originating a message is kept hidden. However, an adversary observing the whole network can analyze the spread pattern of a transaction to trace it back to its source. This is possible thanks to the so-called rumor centrality, which is caused by the symmetry in the spreading of gossip-like protocols. Recent works try to address this issue by breaking the symmetry of the Diffusion protocol, currently used in Bitcoin, and leveraging proxied broadcast. Nonetheless, the complexity of their design can be a barrier to their adoption in real life. In this work, we propose Clover, a novel transaction relay protocol that protects the source of transaction messages with a simple, yet effective, design. Compared to previous solutions, our protocol does not require building propagation graphs, and reduces the ability of the adversary to gain precision by opening multiple connections towards the same node. Experimental results show that the deanonymization accuracy of an eavesdropper adversary against Clover is up to 10 times smaller compared to Diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 3 figures, Accepted to Peer to Peer Network and Applications journal (special issue on Blockchain)</p></details> |

Specifically, given a known network $G=(V, \overrightarrow{E})$ and a (possibly noisy) snapshot $\mathcal{O}_n$ of its state taken at (a possibly unknown) time $W$, we wish to determine the posterior distributions of the initial state of the network and the infection times of its nodes. These distributions are useful in finding source nodes of epidemics and rumors -- $\textit{backward inference}$ -- , and estimating the spread of a fixed set of source nodes -- $\textit{forward inference}$. To model the interaction between the two processes, we study an extension of the independent-cascade (IC) model where, when a node gets infected with either process, its susceptibility to the other one changes. First, we derive the exact joint probability of the initial state of the network and the observation-snapshot $\mathcal{O}_n$. Then, using the machinery of factor-graphs, factor-graph transformations, and the generalized distributive-law, we derive a Belief-Propagation (BP) based algorithm that is scalable to large networks and can converge on graphs of arbitrary topology (at a likely expense in approximation accuracy).</p></details> |  |
| **[Age of Information in Gossip Networks: A Friendly Introduction and Literature Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.16163v1)** | 2023-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gossiping is a communication mechanism, used for fast information dissemination in a network, where each node of the network randomly shares its information with the neighboring nodes. To characterize the notion of fastness in the context of gossip networks, age of information (AoI) is used as a timeliness metric. In this article, we summarize the recent works related to timely gossiping in a network. We start with the introduction of randomized gossip algorithms as an epidemic algorithm for database maintenance, and how the gossiping literature was later developed in the context of rumor spreading, message passing and distributed mean estimation. Then, we motivate the need for timely gossiping in applications such as source tracking and decentralized learning. We evaluate timeliness scaling of gossiping in various network topologies, such as, fully connected, ring, grid, generalized ring, hierarchical, and sparse asymmetric networks. We discuss age-aware gossiping and the higher order moments of the age process. We also consider different variations of gossiping in networks, such as, file slicing and network coding, reliable and unreliable sources, information mutation, different adversarial actions in gossiping, and energy harvesting sensors. Finally, we conclude this article with a few open problems and future directions in timely gossiping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source Localization in Networks: Trees and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.01814v1)** | 2015-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information diffusion in networks can be used to model many real-world phenomena, including rumor spreading on online social networks, epidemics in human beings, and malware on the Internet. Informally speaking, the source localization problem is to identify a node in the network that provides the best explanation of the observed diffusion. Despite significant efforts and successes over last few years, theoretical guarantees of source localization algorithms were established only for tree networks due to the complexity of the problem. This paper presents a new source localization algorithm, called the Short-Fat Tree (SFT) algorithm. Loosely speaking, the algorithm selects the node such that the breadth-first search (BFS) tree from the node has the minimum depth but the maximum number of leaf nodes. Performance guarantees of SFT under the independent cascade (IC) model are established for both tree networks and the Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graph. On tree networks, SFT is the maximum a posterior (MAP) estimator. On the ER random graph, the following fundamental limits have been obtained: $(i)$ when the infection duration $<\frac{2}{3}t_u,$ SFT identifies the source with probability one asymptotically, where $t_u=\left\lceil\frac{\log n}{\log μ}\right\rceil+2$ and $μ$ is the average node degree, $(ii)$ when the infection duration $>t_u,$ the probability of identifying the source approaches zero asymptotically under any algorithm; and $(iii)$ when infection duration $<t_u,$ the BFS tree starting from the source is a fat tree. Numerical experiments on tree networks, the ER random graphs and real world networks with different evaluation metrics show that the SFT algorithm outperforms existing algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Quality of Chatbots and Intelligent Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04579v1)** | 2017-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chatbots are one class of intelligent, conversational software agents activated by natural language input (which can be in the form of text, voice, or both). They provide conversational output in response, and if commanded, can sometimes also execute tasks. Although chatbot technologies have existed since the 1960s and have influenced user interface development in games since the early 1980s, chatbots are now easier to train and implement. This is due to plentiful open source code, widely available development platforms, and implementation options via Software as a Service (SaaS). In addition to enhancing customer experiences and supporting learning, chatbots can also be used to engineer social harm - that is, to spread rumors and misinformation, or attack people for posting their thoughts and opinions online. This paper presents a literature review of quality issues and attributes as they relate to the contemporary issue of chatbot development and implementation. Finally, quality assessment approaches are reviewed, and a quality assessment method based on these attributes and the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is proposed and examined.</p></details> | <details><summary>Softw...</summary><p>Software Quality Professional, June 2017</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Monitoring Social Dynamics During Big Incidences: A Case Study of COVID-19 in Bangladesh](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09667v2)** | 2021-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Newspapers are trustworthy media where people get the most reliable and credible information compared with other sources. On the other hand, social media often spread rumors and misleading news to get more traffic and attention. Careful characterization, evaluation, and interpretation of newspaper data can provide insight into intrigue and passionate social issues to monitor any big social incidence. This study analyzed a large set of spatio-temporal Bangladeshi newspaper data related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The methodology included volume analysis, topic analysis, automated classification, and sentiment analysis of news articles to get insight into the COVID-19 pandemic in different sectors and regions in Bangladesh over a period of time. This analysis will help the government and other organizations to figure out the challenges that have arisen in society due to this pandemic, what steps should be taken immediately and in the post-pandemic period, how the government and its allies can come together to address the crisis in the future, keeping these problems in mind.</p></details> | Very minor change |
| **[Automatically Identifying Fake News in Popular Twitter Threads](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1705.01613v2)** | 2018-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information quality in social media is an increasingly important issue, but web-scale data hinders experts' ability to assess and correct much of the inaccurate content, or `fake news,' present in these platforms. This paper develops a method for automating fake news detection on Twitter by learning to predict accuracy assessments in two credibility-focused Twitter datasets: CREDBANK, a crowdsourced dataset of accuracy assessments for events in Twitter, and PHEME, a dataset of potential rumors in Twitter and journalistic assessments of their accuracies. We apply this method to Twitter content sourced from BuzzFeed's fake news dataset and show models trained against crowdsourced workers outperform models based on journalists' assessment and models trained on a pooled dataset of both crowdsourced workers and journalists. All three datasets, aligned into a uniform format, are also publicly available. A feature analysis then identifies features that are most predictive for crowdsourced and journalistic accuracy assessments, results of which are consistent with prior work. We close with a discussion contrasting accuracy and credibility and why models of non-experts outperform models of journalists for fake news detection in Twitter.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks fail to comprehensively evaluate LLMs and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in realistic misinformation scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RealFactBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the fact-checking capabilities of LLMs and MLLMs across diverse real-world tasks, including Knowledge Validation, Rumor Detection, and Event Verification. RealFactBench consists of 6K high-quality claims drawn from authoritative sources, encompassing multimodal content and diverse domains. Our evaluation framework further introduces the Unknown Rate (UnR) metric, enabling a more nuanced assessment of models' ability to handle uncertainty and balance between over-conservatism and over-confidence. Extensive experiments on 7 representative LLMs and 4 MLLMs reveal their limitations in real-world fact-checking and offer valuable insights for further research. RealFactBench is publicly available at https://github.com/kalendsyang/RealFactBench.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Influential Brokers on Social Media from Social Network Structure](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.00630v1)** | 2025-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying influencers in a given social network has become an important research problem for various applications, including accelerating the spread of information in viral marketing and preventing the spread of fake news and rumors. The literature contains a rich body of studies on identifying influential source spreaders who can spread their own messages to many other nodes. In contrast, the identification of influential brokers who can spread other nodes' messages to many nodes has not been fully explored. Theoretical and empirical studies suggest that involvement of both influential source spreaders and brokers is a key to facilitating large-scale information diffusion cascades. Therefore, this paper explores ways to identify influential brokers from a given social network. By using three social media datasets, we investigate the characteristics of influential brokers by comparing them with influential source spreaders and central nodes obtained from centrality measures. Our results show that (i) most of the influential source spreaders are not influential brokers (and vice versa) and (ii) the overlap between central nodes and influential brokers is small (less than 15%) in Twitter datasets. We also tackle the problem of identifying influential brokers from centrality measures and node embeddings, and we examine the effectiveness of social network features in the broker identification task. Our results show that (iii) although a single centrality measure cannot characterize influential brokers well, prediction models using node embedding features achieve F$_1$ scores of 0.35--0.68, suggesting the effectiveness of social network features for identifying influential brokers.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, to appear in Proceedings of the International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM, 2023)</p></details> |
| **[Capturing Dynamics of Information Diffusion in SNS: A Survey of Methodology and Techniques](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14245v1)** | 2021-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studying information diffusion in SNS (Social Networks Service) has remarkable significance in both academia and industry. Theoretically, it boosts the development of other subjects such as statistics, sociology, and data mining. Practically, diffusion modeling provides fundamental support for many downstream applications (\textit{e.g.}, public opinion monitoring, rumor source identification, and viral marketing.) Tremendous efforts have been devoted to this area to understand and quantify information diffusion dynamics. This survey investigates and summarizes the emerging distinguished works in diffusion modeling. We first put forward a unified information diffusion concept in terms of three components: information, user decision, and social vectors, followed by a detailed introduction of the methodologies for diffusion modeling. And then, a new taxonomy adopting hybrid philosophy (\textit{i.e.,} granularity and techniques) is proposed, and we made a series of comparative studies on elementary diffusion models under our taxonomy from the aspects of assumptions, methods, and pros and cons. We further summarized representative diffusion modeling in special scenarios and significant downstream tasks based on these elementary models. Finally, open issues in this field following the methodology of diffusion modeling are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author version, with 50 pages, 6 figures, 16 tables, and 5 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Social Influence in Event Cascades by Comparing Discriminative Rankers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.06138v2)** | 2019-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The global dynamics of event cascades are often governed by the local dynamics of peer influence. However, detecting social influence from observational data is challenging due to confounds like homophily and practical issues like missing data. We propose a simple discriminative method to detect influence from observational data. The core of the approach is to train a ranking algorithm to predict the source of the next event in a cascade, and compare its out-of-sample accuracy against a competitive baseline which lacks access to features corresponding to social influence. We analyze synthetically generated data to show that this method correctly identifies influence in the presence of confounds, and is robust to both missing data and misspecification --- unlike well-known alternatives. We apply the method to two real-world datasets: (1) the co-sponsorship of legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives on a social network of shared campaign donors; (2) rumors about the Higgs boson discovery on a follower network of $10^5$ Twitter accounts. Our model identifies the role of social influence in these scenarios and uses it to make more accurate predictions about the future trajectory of cascades.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the SIGKDD Workshop on Causal Discovery, 2019</p></details> |
| **[Deterministic Near-Optimal P2P Streaming](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.1931v1)** | 2014-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider streaming over a peer-to-peer network with homogeneous nodes in which a single source broadcasts a data stream to all the users in the system. Peers are allowed to enter or leave the system (adversarially) arbitrarily. Previous approaches for streaming in this setting have either used randomized distribution graphs or structured trees with randomized maintenance algorithms. Randomized graphs handle peer churn well but have poor connectivity guarantees, while structured trees have good connectivity but have proven hard to maintain under peer churn. We improve upon both approaches by presenting a novel distribution structure with a deterministic and distributed algorithm for maintenance under peer churn; our result is inspired by a recent work proposing deterministic algorithms for rumor spreading in graphs. A key innovation in our approach is in having redundant links in the distribution structure. While this leads to a reduction in the maximum streaming rate possible, we show that for the amount of redundancy used, the delay guarantee of the proposed algorithm is near optimal. We introduce a tolerance parameter that captures the worst-case transient streaming rate received by the peers during churn events and characterize the fundamental tradeoff between rate, delay and tolerance. A natural generalization of the deterministic algorithm achieves this tradeoff near optimally. Finally, the proposed deterministic algorithm is robust enough to handle various generalizations: ability to deal with heterogeneous node capacities of the peers and more complicated streaming patterns where multiple source transmissions are present.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Viral Information Spreading via Directed Acyclic Graph Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.05107v2)** | 2023-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Viral information like rumors or fake news is spread over a communication network like a virus infection in a unidirectional manner: entity $i$ conveys information to a neighbor $j$, resulting in two equally informed (infected) parties. Existing graph diffusion works focus only on bidirectional diffusion on an undirected graph. Instead, we propose a new directed acyclic graph (DAG) diffusion model to estimate the probability $x_i(t)$ of node $i$'s infection at time $t$ given a source node $s$, where $x_i(\infty)~=~1$. Specifically, given an undirected positive graph modeling node-to-node communication, we first compute its graph embedding: a latent coordinate for each node in an assumed low-dimensional manifold space from extreme eigenvectors via LOBPCG. Next, we construct a DAG based on Euclidean distances between latent coordinates. Spectrally, we prove that the asymmetric DAG Laplacian matrix contains real non-negative eigenvalues, and that the DAG diffusion converges to the all-infection vector $\x(\infty) = \1$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$. Simulation experiments show that our proposed DAG diffusion accurately models viral information spreading over a variety of graph structures at different time instants.</p></details> |  |

While the virus is spreading from person to person silently, fear has also been spreading around the globe. The COVID-19 information from the Australian Government is convincing but not timely or detailed, and there is much information on social networks with both facts and rumors. As software engineers, we have spontaneously and rapidly constructed a COVID-19 information dashboard aggregating reliable information semi-automatically checked from different sources for providing one-stop information sharing site about the latest status in Australia. Inspired by the John Hopkins University COVID-19 Map, our dashboard contains the case statistics, case distribution, government policy, latest news, with interactive visualization. In this paper, we present a participant's in-person observations in which the authors acted as founders of https://covid-19-au.com/ serving more than 830K users with 14M page views since March 2020. According to our first-hand experience, we summarize 9 lessons for developers, researchers and instructors. These lessons may inspire the development, research and teaching in software engineer aspects for coping with similar public crises in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Inference of Spreading Processes on Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.08862v3)** | 2018-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infectious diseases are studied to understand their spreading mechanisms, to evaluate control strategies and to predict the risk and course of future outbreaks. Because people only interact with a small number of individuals, and because the structure of these interactions matters for spreading processes, the pairwise relationships between individuals in a population can be usefully represented by a network. Although the underlying processes of transmission are different, the network approach can be used to study the spread of pathogens in a contact network or the spread of rumors in an online social network. We study simulated simple and complex epidemics on synthetic networks and on two empirical networks, a social / contact network in an Indian village and an online social network in the U.S. Our goal is to learn simultaneously about the spreading process parameters and the source node (first infected node) of the epidemic, given a fixed and known network structure, and observations about state of nodes at several points in time. Our inference scheme is based on approximate Bayesian computation (ABC), an inference technique for complex models with likelihood functions that are either expensive to evaluate or analytically intractable. ABC enables us to adopt a Bayesian approach to the problem despite the posterior distribution being very complex. Our method is agnostic about the topology of the network and the nature of the spreading process. It generally performs well and, somewhat counter-intuitively, the inference problem appears to be easier on more heterogeneous network topologies, which enhances its future applicability to real-world settings where few networks have homogeneous topologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology comparison of Twitter diffusion networks effectively reveals misleading information](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.03043v4)** | 2020-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, malicious information had an explosive growth in social media, with serious social and political backlashes. Recent important studies, featuring large-scale analyses, have produced deeper knowledge about this phenomenon, showing that misleading information spreads faster, deeper and more broadly than factual information on social media, where echo chambers, algorithmic and human biases play an important role in diffusion networks. Following these directions, we explore the possibility of classifying news articles circulating on social media based exclusively on a topological analysis of their diffusion networks. To this aim we collected a large dataset of diffusion networks on Twitter pertaining to news articles published on two distinct classes of sources, namely outlets that convey mainstream, reliable and objective information and those that fabricate and disseminate various kinds of misleading articles, including false news intended to harm, satire intended to make people laugh, click-bait news that may be entirely factual or rumors that are unproven. We carried out an extensive comparison of these networks using several alignment-free approaches including basic network properties, centrality measures distributions, and network distances. We accordingly evaluated to what extent these techniques allow to discriminate between the networks associated to the aforementioned news domains. Our results highlight that the communities of users spreading mainstream news, compared to those sharing misleading news, tend to shape diffusion networks with subtle yet systematic differences which might be effectively employed to identify misleading and harmful information.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A revised new version is available on Scientific Reports</p></details> |
| **[Complex social contagion induces bistability on multiplex networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00664v2)** | 2021-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social reinforcement mechanism, which characterizes the promoting effects when exposing to multiple sources in social contagion process, is ubiquitous in information-technology ecosystem and has aroused great attention in recent years. While the impacts of social reinforcement on single-layer networks are well-documented, extension to multilayer networks is needed to study how reinforcement from different social circles influences the spreading dynamics. To this end, we incorporate multilayer social reinforcement into ignorant-spreader-ignorant (SIS) model on multiplex networks. Our theoretical analysis combines pairwise method and mean-field theory and agrees well with large-scale simulations. Surprisingly, we find this complex social contagion mechanism triggers the emergence of bistability phenomena, where extinction and outbreak states coexist. In particular, the hysteresis loop of stationary prevalence occurs in this bistable region, explaining why the fight towards the spread of rumors is protracted and difficult in modern society. Further, we show that the final state of bistable regions depends on the initial density of adopters, the critical value of which decreases as the contagion transmissibility or the multilayer reinforcement increases. In particular, we highlight two possible conditions for the outbreak of social contagion: to possess large contagion transmissibility, or to possess large initial density of adopters with strong multilayer reinforcement. Our results unveil the non-negligible power of social reinforcement on multiplex networks, which sheds lights on designing efficient strategies in spreading behaviors such as marketing and promoting innovations.</p></details> |  |

We have identified examples on Twitter where scientific terms that have been misused have been rectified and replaced by scientifically-correct terms through the interaction of users. The results show that the percentage of correct terms ("variant" or "COVID-19 variant") being used instead of the incorrect terms ("strain") on Twitter has already increased since the end of December 2020. This was about a month before the release of an official statement by the Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases regarding the correct terminology, and the use of terms on social media was faster than it was in television. Some Twitter users who quickly started using the correct term were more likely to retweet messages sent by leading influencers on Twitter, rather than messages sent by traditional media or portal sites. However, a few Twitter users continued to use wrong terms even after March 2021, even though the use of the correct terms was widespread. Further analysis of their tweets revealed that they were quoting sources that differed from that of other users. This study empirically verified that self-correction occurs even on Twitter, which is often known as a "hotbed for spreading rumors." The results of this study also suggest that influencers with expertise can influence the direction of public opinion on social media and that the media that users usually cite can also affect the possibility of behavioral changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 2...</summary><p>The 20th IEEE/WIC/ACM International Joint Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT '21)</p></details> |
| **[Fake News Spreader Detection on Twitter using Character N-Grams. Notebook for PAN at CLEF 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13859v1)** | 2020-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The authors of fake news often use facts from verified news sources and mix them with misinformation to create confusion and provoke unrest among the readers. The spread of fake news can thereby have serious implications on our society. They can sway political elections, push down the stock price or crush reputations of corporations or public figures. Several websites have taken on the mission of checking rumors and allegations, but are often not fast enough to check the content of all the news being disseminated. Especially social media websites have offered an easy platform for the fast propagation of information. Towards limiting fake news from being propagated among social media users, the task of this year's PAN 2020 challenge lays the focus on the fake news spreaders. The aim of the task is to determine whether it is possible to discriminate authors that have shared fake news in the past from those that have never done it. In this notebook, we describe our profiling system for the fake news detection task on Twitter. For this, we conduct different feature extraction techniques and learning experiments from a multilingual perspective, namely English and Spanish. Our final submitted systems use character n-grams as features in combination with a linear SVM for English and Logistic Regression for the Spanish language. Our submitted models achieve an overall accuracy of 73% and 79% on the English and Spanish official test set, respectively. Our experiments show that it is difficult to differentiate solidly fake news spreaders on Twitter from users who share credible information leaving room for further investigations. Our model ranked 3rd out of 72 competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>CLEF ...</summary><p>CLEF 2020 Labs and Workshops, Notebook Papers</p></details> |

Given the ongoing evolution of deepfakes investigation of continuous identification and prevention is crucial. Due to recent technological advancements in AI (Artificial Intelligence) distinguishing deepfakes and artificially altered images has become challenging. This approach introduces the robust detection of subtle ear movements and shape changes to generate ear descriptors. Further, we also propose a novel optimized hybrid deepfake detection model that considers the ear biometric descriptors via enhanced RCNN (Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network). Initially, the input video is converted into frames and preprocessed through resizing, normalization, grayscale conversion, and filtering processes followed by face detection using the Viola-Jones technique. Next, a hybrid model comprising DBN (Deep Belief Network) and Bi-GRU (Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit) is utilized for deepfake detection based on ear descriptors. The output from the detection phase is determined through improved score-level fusion. To enhance the performance, the weights of both detection models are optimally tuned using the SU-JFO (Self-Upgraded Jellyfish Optimization method). Experimentation is conducted based on four scenarios: compression, noise, rotation, pose, and illumination on three different datasets. The performance results affirm that our proposed method outperforms traditional models such as CNN (Convolution Neural Network), SqueezeNet, LeNet, LinkNet, LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), DFP (Deepfake Predictor) [1], and ResNext+CNN+LSTM [2] in terms of various performance metrics viz. accuracy, specificity, and precision.</p></details> | Submiited to journal |
