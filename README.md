| **[Diffusion Graph Neural Networks for Robustness in Olfaction Sensors and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00455v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic odour source localization (OSL) is a critical capability for autonomous systems operating in complex environments. However, current OSL methods often suffer from ambiguities, particularly when robots misattribute odours to incorrect objects due to limitations in olfactory datasets and sensor resolutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning method using diffusion-based molecular generation to enhance odour localization accuracy that can be used by itself or with automated olfactory dataset construction pipelines. This generative process of our diffusion model expands the chemical space beyond the limitations of both current olfactory datasets and training methods, enabling the identification of potential odourant molecules not previously documented. The generated molecules can then be more accurately validated using advanced olfactory sensors, enabling them to detect more compounds and inform better hardware design. By integrating visual analysis, language processing, and molecular generation, our framework enhances the ability of olfaction-vision models on robots to accurately associate odours with their correct sources, thereby improving navigation and decision-making through better sensor selection for a target compound in critical applications such as explosives detection, narcotics screening, and search and rescue. Our methodology represents a foundational advancement in the field of artificial olfaction, offering a scalable solution to challenges posed by limited olfactory data and sensor ambiguities.

| **[On Time Delay Interpolation for Improved Acoustic Reflector Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04629v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The localization of acoustic reflectors is a fundamental component in various applications, including room acoustics analysis, sound source localization, and acoustic scene analysis. Time Delay Estimation (TDE) is essential for determining the position of reflectors relative to a sensor array. Traditional TDE algorithms generally yield time delays that are integer multiples of the operating sampling period, potentially lacking sufficient time resolution. To achieve subsample TDE accuracy, various interpolation methods, including parabolic, Gaussian, frequency, and sinc interpolation, have been proposed. This paper presents a comprehensive study on time delay interpolation to achieve subsample accuracy for acoustic reflector localization in reverberant conditions. We derive the Whittaker-Shannon interpolation formula from the previously proposed sinc interpolation in the context of short-time windowed TDE for acoustic reflector localization. Simulations show that sinc and Whittaker-Shannon interpolation outperform existing methods in terms of time delay error and positional error for critically sampled and band-limited reflections. Performance is evaluated on real-world measurements from the MYRiAD dataset, showing that sinc and Whittaker-Shannon interpolation consistently provide reliable performance across different sensor-source pairs and loudspeaker positions. These results can enhance the precision of acoustic reflector localization systems, vital for applications such as room acoustics analysis, sound source localization, and acoustic scene analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 13 figures, 2 tables, submitted to J.

| **[Learning from Silence and Noise for Visual Sound Source Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21761v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual sound source localization is a fundamental perception task that aims to detect the location of sounding sources in a video given its audio. Despite recent progress, we identify two shortcomings in current methods: 1) most approaches perform poorly in cases with low audio-visual semantic correspondence such as silence, noise, and offscreen sounds, i.e. in the presence of negative audio; and 2) most prior evaluations are limited to positive cases, where both datasets and metrics convey scenarios with a single visible sound source in the scene. To address this, we introduce three key contributions. First, we propose a new training strategy that incorporates silence and noise, which improves performance in positive cases, while being more robust against negative sounds. Our resulting self-supervised model, SSL-SaN, achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other self-supervised models, both in sound localization and cross-modal retrieval. Second, we propose a new metric that quantifies the trade-off between alignment and separability of auditory and visual features across positive and negative audio-visual pairs. Third, we present IS3+, an extended and improved version of the IS3 synthetic dataset with negative audio. Our data, metrics and code are available on the https://xavijuanola.github.io/SSL-SaN/.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables + Supplementary Material</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Tracking Antenna System for Moving Targets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20905v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the design and implementation of a compact, cost-effective phased array antenna system. It is capable of real-time beam-steering for dynamic target-tracking applications. The system employs a 4$\times$4 rectangular microstrip patch array, utilizing advanced beamforming techniques and a Direction of Arrival (DoA) estimation algorithm. It achieves $\pm 42^{\circ}$ wide-angle scanning in both azimuth and elevation planes. The design emphasizes a balance between high angular coverage and consistent gain performance. This makes it suitable for wireless tracking, radar, and satellite communication terminals. Fabricated on Rogers 6010.2LM substrate, the system demonstrates reproducibility and scalability. All components are sourced locally to ensure practical deployment. The system is built using commercially available components, highlighting its affordability for research and prototyping purposes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Take That for Me: Multimodal Exophora Resolution with Interactive Questioning for Ambiguous Out-of-View Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16143v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Daily life support robots must interpret ambiguous verbal instructions involving demonstratives such as ``Bring me that cup,'' even when objects or users are out of the robot's view. Existing approaches to exophora resolution primarily rely on visual data and thus fail in real-world scenarios where the object or user is not visible. We propose Multimodal Interactive Exophora resolution with user Localization (MIEL), which is a multimodal exophora resolution framework leveraging sound source localization (SSL), semantic mapping, visual-language models (VLMs), and interactive questioning with GPT-4o. Our approach first constructs a semantic map of the environment and estimates candidate objects from a linguistic query with the user's skeletal data. SSL is utilized to orient the robot toward users who are initially outside its visual field, enabling accurate identification of user gestures and pointing directions. When ambiguities remain, the robot proactively interacts with the user, employing GPT-4o to formulate clarifying questions. Experiments in a real-world environment showed results that were approximately 1.3 times better when the user was visible to the robot and 2.0 times better when the user was not visible to the robot, compared to the methods without SSL and interactive questioning.

| **[BEASST: Behavioral Entropic Gradient based Adaptive Source Seeking for Mobile Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10363v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents BEASST (Behavioral Entropic Gradient-based Adaptive Source Seeking for Mobile Robots), a novel framework for robotic source seeking in complex, unknown environments. Our approach enables mobile robots to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation by modeling normalized signal strength as a surrogate probability of source location. Building on Behavioral Entropy(BE) with Prelec's probability weighting function, we define an objective function that adapts robot behavior from risk-averse to risk-seeking based on signal reliability and mission urgency. The framework provides theoretical convergence guarantees under unimodal signal assumptions and practical stability under bounded disturbances. Experimental validation across DARPA SubT and multi-room scenarios demonstrates that BEASST consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 15% reduction in path length and 20% faster source localization through intelligent uncertainty-driven navigation that dynamically transitions between aggressive pursuit and cautious exploration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Direction Estimation of Sound Sources Using Microphone Arrays and Signal Strength](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03466v2)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound-tracking refers to the process of determining the direction from which a sound originates, making it a fundamental component of sound source localization. This capability is essential in a variety of applications, including security systems, acoustic monitoring, and speaker tracking, where accurately identifying the direction of a sound source enables real-time responses, efficient resource allocation, and improved situational awareness. While sound-tracking is closely related to localization, it specifically focuses on identifying the direction of the sound source rather than estimating its exact position in space. Despite its utility, sound-tracking systems face several challenges, such as maintaining directional accuracy and precision, along with the need for sophisticated hardware configurations and complex signal processing algorithms. This paper presents a sound-tracking method using three electret microphones. We estimate the direction of a sound source using a lightweight method that analyzes signals from three strategically placed microphones. By comparing the average power of the received signals, the system infers the most probable direction of the sound. The results indicate that the power level from each microphone effectively determines the sound source direction. Our system employs a straightforward and cost-effective hardware design, ensuring simplicity and affordability in implementation. It achieves a localization error of less than 6 degrees and a precision of 98%. Additionally, its effortless integration with various systems makes it versatile and adaptable. Consequently, this technique presents a robust and reliable solution for sound-tracking and localization, with potential applications spanning diverse domains such as security systems, smart homes, and acoustic monitoring.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[AV-SSAN: Audio-Visual Selective DoA Estimation through Explicit Multi-Band Semantic-Spatial Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07384v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-visual sound source localization (AV-SSL) estimates the position of sound sources by fusing auditory and visual cues. Current AV-SSL methodologies typically require spatially-paired audio-visual data and cannot selectively localize specific target sources. To address these limitations, we introduce Cross-Instance Audio-Visual Localization (CI-AVL), a novel task that localizes target sound sources using visual prompts from different instances of the same semantic class. CI-AVL enables selective localization without spatially paired data. To solve this task, we propose AV-SSAN, a semantic-spatial alignment framework centered on a Multi-Band Semantic-Spatial Alignment Network (MB-SSA Net). MB-SSA Net decomposes the audio spectrogram into multiple frequency bands, aligns each band with semantic visual prompts, and refines spatial cues to estimate the direction-of-arrival (DoA). To facilitate this research, we construct VGGSound-SSL, a large-scale dataset comprising 13,981 spatial audio clips across 296 categories, each paired with visual prompts. AV-SSAN achieves a mean absolute error of 16.59 and an accuracy of 71.29%, significantly outperforming existing AV-SSL methods. Code and data will be public.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Beamformed 360° Sound Maps: U-Net-Driven Acoustic Source Segmentation and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00307v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a U-net model for 360{\deg} acoustic source localization formulated as a spherical semantic segmentation task. Rather than regressing discrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio maps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate signals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A modified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps, learns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class imbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed energy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to different microphone configurations without retraining from scratch. The segmentation outputs are post-processed by computing centroids over activated regions, enabling robust DoA estimates. Our dataset includes real-world open-field recordings of a DJI Air 3 drone, synchronized with 360{\deg} video and flight logs across multiple dates and locations. Experimental results show that U-net generalizes across environments, providing improved angular precision, offering a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding beyond traditional Sound Source Localization (SSL).</p></details> |  |
| **[The Effect of Prior Parameters on Standardized Kalman Filter-Based EEG Source Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23450v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>EEG Source localization is a critical tool in neuroscience, with applications ranging from epilepsy diagnosis to cognitive research. It involves solving an ill-posed inverse problem that lacks a unique solution unless constrained by prior knowledge. The Bayesian framework enables the incorporation of such knowledge, typically encoded through prior models. Various algorithms have been proposed for source localization, and they differ significantly in how prior knowledge is incorporated. Some approaches rely on anatomical or functional constraints, while others use statistical distributions or sampling-based techniques. In this landscape, the Standardized Kalman Filter (SKF) represents a dynamic Bayesian approach that integrates temporal modeling with a Gaussian prior structure. It addresses the depth bias, a common limitation in source localization, through a post-hoc standardization step that equalizes sensitivity across cortical depths and makes deep activity detection feasible. This study focuses on the development and optimization of Gaussian prior models within the SKF framework for simultaneous cortical and sub-cortical activity detection. Synthetic data similar to the P20 / N20 component of the somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) was used to identify effective prior parameter configurations for reconstructing both deep and superficial sources under different noise levels. We also investigated the role of RTS smoothing in enhancing source separability. Our results indicate that raising the standardization exponent to 1.25, along with smoothing, significantly improves depth localization accuracy at low noise levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sound Source Localization for Human-Robot Interaction in Outdoor Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21431v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a sound source localization strategy that relies on a microphone array embedded in an unmanned ground vehicle and an asynchronous close-talking microphone near the operator. A signal coarse alignment strategy is combined with a time-domain acoustic echo cancellation algorithm to estimate a time-frequency ideal ratio mask to isolate the target speech from interferences and environmental noise. This allows selective sound source localization, and provides the robot with the direction of arrival of sound from the active operator, which enables rich interaction in noisy scenarios. Results demonstrate an average angle error of 4 degrees and an accuracy within 5 degrees of 95\% at a signal-to-noise ratio of 1dB, which is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art localization methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[BleedOrigin: Dynamic Bleeding Source Localization in Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection via Dual-Stage Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15094v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intraoperative bleeding during Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection (ESD) poses significant risks, demanding precise, real-time localization and continuous monitoring of the bleeding source for effective hemostatic intervention. In particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with 39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6 challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |
| **[LOCUS: LOcalization with Channel Uncertainty and Sporadic Energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09409v3)** | 2025-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate sound source localization (SSL), such as direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation, relies on consistent multichannel data. However, batteryless systems often suffer from missing data due to the stochastic nature of energy harvesting, degrading localization performance. We propose LOCUS, a deep learning framework that recovers corrupted features in such settings. LOCUS integrates three modules: (1) Information-Weighted Focus (InFo) to identify corrupted regions, (2) Latent Feature Synthesizer (LaFS) to reconstruct missing features, and (3) Guided Replacement (GRep) to restore data without altering valid inputs. LOCUS significantly improves DoA accuracy under missing-channel conditions, achieving up to 36.91% error reduction on DCASE and LargeSet, and 25.87-59.46% gains in real-world deployments. We release a 50-hour multichannel dataset to support future research on localization under energy constraints. Our code and data are available at: https://bashlab.github.io/locus_project/</p></details> |  |
| **[Experimental Setup and Software Pipeline to Evaluate Optimization based Autonomous Multi-Robot Search Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16710v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal source localization has been a problem of interest in the multi-robot systems domain given its applications in search & rescue and hazard localization in various industrial and outdoor settings. A variety of multi-robot search algorithms exist that usually formulate and solve the associated autonomous motion planning problem as a heuristic model-free or belief model-based optimization process. Most of these algorithms however remains tested only in simulation, thereby losing the opportunity to generate knowledge about how such algorithms would compare/contrast in a real physical setting in terms of search performance and real-time computing performance. To address this gap, this paper presents a new lab-scale physical setup and associated open-source software pipeline to evaluate and benchmark multi-robot search algorithms. The presented physical setup innovatively uses an acoustic source (that is safe and inexpensive) and small ground robots (e-pucks) operating in a standard motion-capture environment. This setup can be easily recreated and used by most robotics researchers. The acoustic source also presents interesting uncertainty in terms of its noise-to-signal ratio, which is useful to assess sim-to-real gaps. The overall software pipeline is designed to readily interface with any multi-robot search algorithm with minimal effort and is executable in parallel asynchronous form. This pipeline includes a framework for distributed implementation of multi-robot or swarm search algorithms, integrated with a ROS (Robotics Operating System)-based software stack for motion capture supported localization. The utility of this novel setup is demonstrated by using it to evaluate two state-of-the-art multi-robot search algorithms, based on swarm optimization and batch-Bayesian Optimization (called Bayes-Swarm), as well as a random walk baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of ASME IDETC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Sensor Requirements by Relaxing the Network Metric Dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11193v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source localization in graphs involves identifying the origin of a phenomenon or event, such as an epidemic outbreak or a misinformation source, by leveraging structural graph properties. One key concept in this context is the metric dimension, which quantifies the minimum number of strategically placed sensors needed to uniquely identify all vertices based on their distances. While powerful, the traditional metric dimension imposes a stringent requirement that every vertex must be uniquely identified, often necessitating a large number of sensors. In this work, we relax the metric dimension and allow vertices at a graph distance less than k to share identical distance profiles relative to the sensors. This relaxation reduces the number of sensors needed while maintaining sufficient resolution for practical applications like source localization and network monitoring. We provide two main theoretical contributions: an analysis of the k-relaxed metric dimension in deterministic trees, revealing the interplay between structural properties and sensor placement, and an extension to random trees generated by branching processes, offering insights into stochastic settings. We also conduct numerical experiments across a variety of graph types, including random trees, random geometric graphs, and real-world networks. The results show that the relaxed metric dimension is significantly smaller than the traditional metric dimension. Furthermore, the number of vertices indistinguishable from any given target vertex always remains small. Finally, we propose and evaluate a two-step localization strategy that balances the trade-off between resolution and the number of sensors required. This strategy identifies an optimal relaxation level that minimizes the total number of sensors across both steps, providing a practical and efficient approach to source localization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent and Asymptotically Efficient Localization from Bearing-only Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07647v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of signal source localization using bearing-only measurements. Initially, we present easily verifiable geometric conditions for sensor deployment to ensure the asymptotic identifiability of the model and demonstrate the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. However, obtaining the ML estimator is challenging due to its association with a non-convex optimization problem. To address this, we propose a two-step estimator that shares the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator while offering low computational complexity, linear in the number of measurements. The primary challenge lies in obtaining a preliminary consistent estimator in the first step. To achieve this, we construct a linear least-squares problem through algebraic operations on the measurement nonlinear model to first obtain a biased closed-form solution. We then eliminate the bias using the data to yield an asymptotically unbiased and consistent estimator. The key to this process is obtaining a consistent estimator of the variance of the sine of the noise by taking the reciprocal of the maximum eigenvalue of a specially constructed matrix from the data. In the second step, we perform a single Gauss-Newton iteration using the preliminary consistent estimator as the initial value, achieving the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed two-step estimator for large sample sizes.</p></details> |  |
| **[SonicMotion: Dynamic Spatial Audio Soundscapes with Latent Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07318v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial audio is an integral part of immersive entertainment, such as VR/AR, and has seen increasing popularity in cinema and music as well. The most common format of spatial audio is described as first-order Ambisonics (FOA). We seek to extend recent advancements in FOA generative AI models to enable the generation of 3D scenes with dynamic sound sources. Our proposed end-to-end model, SonicMotion, comes in two variations which vary in their user input and level of precision in sound source localization. In addition to our model, we also present a new dataset of simulated spatial audio-caption pairs. Evaluation of our models demonstrate that they are capable of matching the semantic alignment and audio quality of state of the art models while capturing the desired spatial attributes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Model Parameter Learning in Linear Inverse Problems: Application in EEG Focal Source Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13109v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse problems can be described as limited-data problems in which the signal of interest cannot be observed directly. A physics-based forward model that relates the signal with the observations is typically needed. Unfortunately, unknown model parameters and imperfect forward models can undermine the signal recovery. Even though supervised machine learning offers promising avenues to improve the robustness of the solutions, we have to rely on model-based learning when there is no access to ground truth for the training. Here, we studied a linear inverse problem that included an unknown non-linear model parameter and utilized a Bayesian model-based learning approach that allowed signal recovery and subsequently estimation of the model parameter. This approach, called Bayesian Approximation Error approach, employed a simplified model of the physics of the problem augmented with an approximation error term that compensated for the simplification. An error subspace was spanned with the help of the eigenvectors of the approximation error covariance matrix which allowed, alongside the primary signal, simultaneous estimation of the induced error. The estimated error and signal were then used to determine the unknown model parameter. For the model parameter estimation, we tested different approaches: a conditional Gaussian regression, an iterative (model-based) optimization, and a Gaussian process that was modeled with the help of physics-informed learning. In addition, alternating optimization was used as a reference method. As an example application, we focused on the problem of reconstructing brain activity from EEG recordings under the condition that the electrical conductivity of the patient's skull was unknown in the model. Our results demonstrated clear improvements in EEG source localization accuracy and provided feasible estimates for the unknown model parameter, skull conductivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Illuminant and light direction estimation using Wasserstein distance method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05802v2)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Illumination estimation remains a pivotal challenge in image processing, particularly for robotics, where robust environmental perception is essential under varying lighting conditions. Traditional approaches, such as RGB histograms and GIST descriptors, often fail in complex scenarios due to their sensitivity to illumination changes. This study introduces a novel method utilizing the Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport theory, to estimate illuminant and light direction in images. Experiments on diverse images indoor scenes, black-and-white photographs, and night images demonstrate the method's efficacy in detecting dominant light sources and estimating their directions, outperforming traditional statistical methods in complex lighting environments. The approach shows promise for applications in light source localization, image quality assessment, and object detection enhancement. Future research may explore adaptive thresholding and integrate gradient analysis to enhance accuracy, offering a scalable solution for real-world illumination challenges in robotics and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Review on Sound Source Localization in Robotics: Focusing on Deep Learning Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01143v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound source localization (SSL) adds a spatial dimension to auditory perception, allowing a system to pinpoint the origin of speech, machinery noise, warning tones, or other acoustic events, capabilities that facilitate robot navigation, human-machine dialogue, and condition monitoring. While existing surveys provide valuable historical context, they typically address general audio applications and do not fully account for robotic constraints or the latest advancements in deep learning. This review addresses these gaps by offering a robotics-focused synthesis, emphasizing recent progress in deep learning methodologies. We start by reviewing classical methods such as Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA), beamforming, Steered-Response Power (SRP), and subspace analysis. Subsequently, we delve into modern machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches, discussing traditional ML and neural networks (NNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), convolutional recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), and emerging attention-based architectures. The data and training strategy that are the two cornerstones of DL-based SSL are explored. Studies are further categorized by robot types and application domains to facilitate researchers in identifying relevant work for their specific contexts. Finally, we highlight the current challenges in SSL works in general, regarding environmental robustness, sound source multiplicity, and specific implementation constraints in robotics, as well as data and learning strategies in DL-based SSL. Also, we sketch promising directions to offer an actionable roadmap toward robust, adaptable, efficient, and explainable DL-based SSL for next-generation robots.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[Cyber Attacks Detection, Prevention, and Source Localization in Digital Substation Communication using Hybrid Statistical-Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00522v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The digital transformation of power systems is accelerating the adoption of IEC 61850 standard. However, its communication protocols, including Sampled Values (SV), lack built-in security features such as authentication and encryption, making them vulnerable to malicious packet injection. Such cyber attacks can delay fault clearance or trigger unintended circuit breaker operations. While most existing research focuses on detecting cyber attacks in digital substations, intrusion prevention systems have been disregarded because of the risk of potential communication network disruptions. This paper proposes a novel method using hybrid statistical-deep learning for the detection, prevention, and source localization of IEC 61850 SV injection attacks. The method uses exponentially modified Gaussian distributions to model communication network latency and long short-term memory and Elman recurrent neural network to detect anomalous variations in the estimated probability distributions. It effectively discards malicious SV frames with minimal processing overhead and latency, maintains robustness against communication network latency variation and time-synchronization issues, and guarantees a near-zero false positive rate in non-attack scenarios. Comprehensive validation is conducted on three testbeds involving industrial-grade devices, hardware-in-the-loop simulations, virtualized intelligent electronic devices and merging units, and high-fidelity emulated communication networks. Results demonstrate the method's suitability for practical deployment in IEC 61850-compliant digital substations.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures.

Loss functions play a central role in optimizing and evaluating algorithms that generate binaural signals. However, traditional signal-related difference measures often fail to capture the perceptual properties that are essential to spatial audio quality. This review paper surveys recent loss functions that incorporate spatial perception cues relevant to binaural reproduction. It focuses on losses applied to binaural signals, which are often derived from microphone recordings or Ambisonics signals, while excluding those based on room impulse responses. Guided by the Spatial Audio Quality Inventory (SAQI), the review emphasizes perceptual dimensions related to source localization and room response, while excluding general spectral-temporal attributes. The literature survey reveals a strong focus on localization cues, such as interaural time and level differences (ITDs, ILDs), while reverberation and other room acoustic attributes remain less explored in loss function design. Recent works that estimate room acoustic parameters and develop embeddings that capture room characteristics indicate their potential for future integration into neural network training. The paper concludes by highlighting future research directions toward more perceptually grounded loss functions that better capture the listener's spatial experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to I3DA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Object-aware Sound Source Localization via Audio-Visual Scene Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18557v2)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-visual sound source localization task aims to spatially localize sound-making objects within visual scenes by integrating visual and audio cues. However, existing methods struggle with accurately localizing sound-making objects in complex scenes, particularly when visually similar silent objects coexist. This limitation arises primarily from their reliance on simple audio-visual correspondence, which does not capture fine-grained semantic differences between sound-making and silent objects. To address these challenges, we propose a novel sound source localization framework leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate detailed contextual information that explicitly distinguishes between sound-making foreground objects and silent background objects. To effectively integrate this detailed information, we introduce two novel loss functions: Object-aware Contrastive Alignment (OCA) loss and Object Region Isolation (ORI) loss.

Specifically, a physics-informed neural network, referred to as Neural Steerer, is used to interpolate measured steering vectors (SVs) on a fixed microphone array. This allows for a more robust estimation of the so-called $\alpha$-stable spatial measure, which represents the most plausible direction of arrival (DOA) of a target signal. As an $\alpha$-stable model for the non-Gaussian case ($\alpha$ $\in$ (0, 2)) theoretically defines a unique spatial measure, we choose to leverage it to account for residual reconstruction error of the Neural Steerer in the downstream tasks. The objective scores indicate that our proposed technique outperforms state-of-the-art methods in the case of multiple sound sources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Europ...</summary><p>European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO), Sep 2025, Palermo, Italy</p></details> |

However, existing sound source localization methods typically rely on a microphone array with at least two spatially preconfigured microphones. This requirement hinders the applicability of microphone-based robot audition systems and technologies. To alleviate these challenges, we propose an online sound source localization method that uses a single microphone mounted on a mobile robot in reverberant environments. Specifically, we develop a lightweight neural network model with only 43k parameters to perform real-time distance estimation by extracting temporal information from reverberant signals. The estimated distances are then processed using an extended Kalman filter to achieve online sound source localization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve online sound source localization using a single microphone on a moving robot, a gap that we aim to fill in this work. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our approach. To benefit the broader research community, we have open-sourced our code at https://github.com/JiangWAV/single-mic-SSL.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted and going to appear in the 2025 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce the first application of graph-based learning for jamming source localization, addressing the imminent threat of jamming attacks in wireless networks. Unlike geometric optimization techniques that struggle under environmental uncertainties and dense interference, we reformulate the localization as an inductive graph regression task. Our approach integrates structured node representations that encode local and global signal aggregation, ensuring spatial coherence and adaptive signal fusion. To enhance robustness, we incorporate an attention-based \ac{GNN} that adaptively refines neighborhood influence and introduces a confidence-guided estimation mechanism that dynamically balances learned predictions with domain-informed priors. We evaluate our approach under complex \ac{RF} environments with various sampling densities, network topologies, jammer characteristics, and signal propagation conditions, conducting comprehensive ablation studies on graph construction, feature selection, and pooling strategies. Results demonstrate that our novel graph-based learning framework significantly outperforms established localization baselines, particularly in challenging scenarios with sparse and obfuscated signal information.

However, the ability of Speech LLMs to comprehend and process multi-channel audio with spatial cues remains a relatively uninvestigated area of research. In this work, we present directional-SpeechLlama, a novel approach that leverages the microphone array of smart glasses to achieve directional speech recognition, source localization, and bystander cross-talk suppression. To enhance the model's ability to understand directivity, we propose two key techniques: serialized directional output training (S-DOT) and contrastive direction data augmentation (CDDA).

Unlike conventional tasks such as action recognition and temporal action localization, which broadly analyze video content, our task focuses on the distinct kinematic dynamics of audible actions. It is based on the premise that key actions are driven by inflectional movements; for example, collisions that produce sound often involve abrupt changes in motion. To capture this, we propose $TA^{2}Net$, a novel architecture that estimates inflectional flow using the second derivative of motion to determine collision timings without relying on audio input. $TA^{2}Net$ also integrates a self-supervised spatial localization strategy during training, combining contrastive learning with spatial analysis. This dual design improves temporal localization accuracy and simultaneously identifies sound sources within video frames. To support this task, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, $Audible623$, derived from Kinetics and UCF101 by removing non-essential vocalization subsets. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach on $Audible623$ and show strong generalizability to other domains, such as repetitive counting and sound source localization.

The proposed filter is first tested with a benchmark numerical problem to validate the performance with other state-of-the-practice approaches such as Particle Filter (PF) and Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) filters. Then the proposed approach is tested and compared against PF and PGM filters in real-world robotic field experiments to validate its impact for real-world applications. The considered real-world scenarios have partial observability with the range-only measurement and uncertainty with the measurement model. The results show that the proposed filter can handle this partial observability effectively whilst showing improved performance compared to PF, reducing the computation requirements while demonstrating improved robustness over compared techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Performance Assessment of Multi-Source-Localization for Autonomous Driving Systems Using Subjective Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02932v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving (AD) relies heavily on high precision localization as a crucial part of all driving related software components. The precise positioning is necessary for the utilization of high-definition maps, prediction of other road participants and the controlling of the vehicle itself. Due to this reason, the localization is absolutely safety relevant. Typical errors of the localization systems, which are long term drifts, jumps and false localization, that must be detected to enhance safety. An online assessment and evaluation of the current localization performance is a challenging task, which is usually done by Kalman filtering for single localization systems. Current autonomous vehicles cope with these challenges by fusing multiple individual localization methods into an overall state estimation. Such approaches need expert knowledge for a competitive performance in challenging environments. This expert knowledge is based on the trust and the prioritization of distinct localization methods in respect to the current situation and environment. This work presents a novel online performance assessment technique of multiple localization systems by using subjective logic (SL). In our research vehicles, three different systems for localization are available, namely odometry-, Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM)- and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-based. Our performance assessment models the behavior of these three localization systems individually and puts them into reference of each other. The experiments were carried out using the CoCar NextGen, which is based on an Audi A6. The vehicle's localization system was evaluated under challenging conditions, specifically within a tunnel environment. The overall evaluation shows the feasibility of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE IAVVC 2025</p></details> |

While recent deep generative approaches have shown promise in this domain, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of real-world propagation data. This paper introduces SIDSL (\textbf{S}tructure-prior \textbf{I}nformed \textbf{D}iffusion model for \textbf{S}ource \textbf{L}ocalization), a novel framework that addresses three key challenges in limited-data scenarios: unknown propagation patterns, complex topology-propagation relationships, and class imbalance between source and non-source nodes. SIDSL incorporates topology-aware priors through graph label propagation and employs a propagation-enhanced conditional denoiser with a GNN-parameterized label propagation module (GNN-LP). Additionally, we propose a structure-prior biased denoising scheme that initializes from structure-based source estimations rather than random noise, effectively countering class imbalance issues. Experimental results across four real-world datasets demonstrate SIDSL's superior performance, achieving 7.5-13.3% improvements in F1 scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, when pretrained with simulation data of synthetic patterns, SIDSL maintains robust performance with only 10% of training data, surpassing baselines by more than 18.8%. These results highlight SIDSL's effectiveness in real-world applications where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> |  |

We begin by presenting verifiable geometric conditions for sensor deployment that ensure the model's asymptotic localizability. Then we establish the consistency and asymptotic efficiency of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator. However, computing the ML estimator is challenging due to its reliance on solving a non-convex optimization problem. To overcome this, we propose a two-step estimator that retains the same asymptotic properties as the ML estimator while offering low computational complexity, linear in the number of measurements. The main challenge lies in obtaining a consistent estimator in the first step. To address this, we construct two linear least-squares estimation problems by applying algebraic transformations to the nonlinear measurement model, leading to closed-form solutions. In the second step, we perform a single Gauss-Newton iteration using the consistent estimator from the first step as the initialization, achieving the same asymptotic efficiency as the ML estimator. Finally, simulation results validate the theoretical property and practical effectiveness of the proposed two-step estimator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Sound Source Localization with Joint Slot Attention on Image and Audio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15118v2)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound source localization (SSL) is the task of locating the source of sound within an image. Due to the lack of localization labels, the de facto standard in SSL has been to represent an image and audio as a single embedding vector each, and use them to learn SSL via contrastive learning. To this end, previous work samples one of local image features as the image embedding and aggregates all local audio features to obtain the audio embedding, which is far from optimal due to the presence of noise and background irrelevant to the actual target in the input. We present a novel SSL method that addresses this chronic issue by joint slot attention on image and audio. To be specific, two slots competitively attend image and audio features to decompose them into target and off-target representations, and only target representations of image and audio are used for contrastive learning. Also, we introduce cross-modal attention matching to further align local features of image and audio. Our method achieved the best in almost all settings on three public benchmarks for SSL, and substantially outperformed all the prior work in cross-modal retrieval.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we extend the application of CLIP to sound source localization, proposing a self-supervised method operates without explicit text input. We introduce a framework that maps audios into tokens compatible with CLIP's text encoder, producing audio-driven embeddings. These embeddings are used to generate sounding region masks, from which visual features are extracted and aligned with the audio embeddings through a contrastive audio-visual correspondence objective. Our findings show that alignment knowledge of pre-trained multimodal foundation model enables our method to generate more complete and compact localization for sounding objects. We further propose an LLM-guided extension that distills object-aware audio-visual scene understanding into the model during training to enhance alignment. Extensive experiments across five diverse tasks demonstrate that our method, in all variants, outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and achieves strong generalization in zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Extension of WACV 2024 paper (arXiv:2311.04066).

Despite their wide applicability, processing multi-channel audio signals from microphone arrays in SSL involves computationally intensive matrix operations, which can hinder efficient deployment on Central Processing Units (CPUs), particularly in embedded systems with limited CPU resources. This paper introduces a GPU-based implementation of SSL for robot audition, utilizing the Generalized Singular Value Decomposition-based Multiple Signal Classification (GSVD-MUSIC), a noise-robust algorithm, within the HARK platform, an open-source software suite. For a 60-channel microphone array, the proposed implementation achieves significant performance improvements. On the Jetson AGX Orin, an embedded device powered by an NVIDIA GPU and ARM Cortex-A78AE v8.2 64-bit CPUs, we observe speedups of 5648.7x for GSVD calculations and 10.7x for the SSL module, while speedups of 4245.1x for GSVD calculation and 17.3x for the entire SSL module on a server configured with an NVIDIA A100 GPU and AMD EPYC 7352 CPUs, making real-time processing feasible for large-scale microphone arrays and providing ample capacity for real-time processing of potential subsequent machine learning or deep learning tasks.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

High-quality RIR estimates drive applications such as virtual microphones, sound source localization, augmented reality, and data augmentation. However, obtaining RIR measurements with high spatial resolution is resource-intensive, making it impractical for large spaces or when dense sampling is required. This research addresses the challenge of estimating RIRs at unmeasured locations within a room using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM). Our method leverages the analogy between RIR matrices and image inpainting, transforming RIR data into a format suitable for diffusion-based reconstruction. Using simulated RIR data based on the image method, we demonstrate our approach's effectiveness on microphone arrays of different curvatures, from linear to semi-circular. Our method successfully reconstructs missing RIRs, even in large gaps between microphones. Under these conditions, it achieves accurate reconstruction, significantly outperforming baseline Spline Cubic Interpolation in terms of Normalized Mean Square Error and Cosine Distance between actual and interpolated RIRs. This research highlights the potential of using generative models for effective RIR interpolation, paving the way for generating additional data from limited real-world measurements.</p></details> |  |

However, unlike human social learning, they lack a critical pathway for intrinsic cognitive development, namely, learning from human feedback during interaction. To understand human ubiquitous observation, supervision, and shared control in dynamic and uncertain environments, this study presents a brain-computer interface (BCI) framework that enables classification of Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals to detect cognitively demanding and safety-critical events. As a timely and motivating co-robotic engineering application, we simulate a human-in-the-loop scenario to flag risky events in semi-autonomous robotic driving-representative of long-tail cases that pose persistent bottlenecks to the safety performance of smart mobility systems and robotic vehicles. Drawing on recent advances in few-shot learning, we propose a dual-attention Siamese convolutional network paired with Dynamic Time Warping Barycenter Averaging approach to generate robust EEG-encoded signal representations. Inverse source localization reveals activation in Broadman areas 4 and 9, indicating perception-action coupling during task-relevant mental imagery. The model achieves 80% classification accuracy under data-scarce conditions and exhibits a nearly 100% increase in the utility of salient features compared to state-of-the-art methods, as measured through integrated gradient attribution. Beyond performance, this study contributes to our understanding of the cognitive architecture required for BCI agents-particularly the role of attention and memory mechanisms-in categorizing diverse mental states and supporting both inter- and intra-subject adaptation. Overall, this research advances the development of cognitive robotics and socially guided learning for service robots in complex built environments.</p></details> | 50 pages, 18 figures |

Since sensor-source geometry significantly impacts localization accuracy, the strategies of optimal sensor placement are proposed systematically using combinations of hybrid measurements. Firstly, the relationship between sensor placement and source estimation accuracy is formulated by a derived Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB). Secondly, the A-optimality criterion, i.e., minimizing the trace of the CRB, is selected to calculate the smallest reachable estimation mean-squared-error (MSE) in a unified manner. Thirdly, the optimal sensor placement strategies are developed to achieve the optimal estimation bound. Specifically, the specific constraints of the optimal geometries deduced by specific measurement, i.e., TDOA, AOA, RSS, and TOA, are found and discussed theoretically. Finally, the new findings are verified by simulation studies.</p></details> |  |

In fact, sound source localization and separation are interconnected problems, that is, sound source localization facilitates sound separation while sound separation contributes to refined source localization. This paper proposes a method utilizing the mutual facilitation mechanism between sound source localization and separation for moving sources. The proposed method comprises three stages. The first stage is initial tracking, which tracks each sound source from the audio mixture based on the source signal envelope estimation. These tracking results may lack sufficient accuracy. The second stage involves mutual facilitation: Sound separation is conducted using preliminary sound source tracking results. Subsequently, sound source tracking is performed on the separated signals, thereby refining the tracking precision. The refined trajectories further improve separation performance. This mutual facilitation process can be iterated multiple times. In the third stage, a neural beamformer estimates precise single-channel separation results based on the refined tracking trajectories and multi-channel separation outputs. Simulation experiments conducted under reverberant conditions and with moving sound sources demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve more accurate separation based on refined tracking results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing(TASLP)</p></details> |

More precisely, given a discrete multichannel RIR generated by the shoebox ISM for a microphone array of known geometry, the algorithm reliably recovers the 18 input parameters. These are the 3D source position, the 3 dimensions of the room, the 6-degrees-of-freedom room translation and orientation, and an absorption coefficient for each of the 6 room boundaries. The approach builds on a recently proposed gridless image source localization technique combined with new procedures for room axes recovery and first-order-reflection identification. Extensive simulated experiments reveal that near-exact recovery of all parameters is achieved for a 32-element, 8.4-cm-wide spherical microphone array and a sampling rate of 16~kHz using fully randomized input parameters within rooms of size 2X2X2 to 10X10X5 meters. Estimation errors decay towards zero when increasing the array size and sampling rate. The method is also shown to strongly outperform a known baseline, and its ability to extrapolate RIRs at new positions is demonstrated. Crucially, the approach is strictly limited to low-passed discrete RIRs simulated using the vanilla shoebox ISM. Nonetheless, it represents to our knowledge the first algorithmic demonstration that this difficult inverse problem is in-principle fully solvable over a wide range of configurations.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring annotations for a video is costly, and semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been studied to improve performance even with a small number of labeled data in the task. Prior studies for semi-supervised video action recognition have mostly focused on using single modality - visuals - but the video is multi-modal, so utilizing both visuals and audio would be desirable and improve performance further, which has not been explored well. Therefore, we propose audio-visual SSL for video action recognition, which uses both visual and audio together, even with quite a few labeled data, which is challenging. In addition, to maximize the information of audio and video, we propose a novel audio source localization-guided mixup method that considers inter-modal relations between video and audio modalities. In experiments on UCF-51, Kinetics-400, and VGGSound datasets, our model shows the superior performance of the proposed semi-supervised audio-visual action recognition framework and audio source localization-guided mixup.</p></details> |  |

Yet, state-of-the-art research mainly focuses on optimizing algorithmic accuracy, resulting in huge models preventing edge-device deployment. The edge, however, urges for real-time low-footprint acoustic reasoning for applications such as hearing aids and robot interactions. Hence, we set off from a robust CNN-based model using SRP-PHAT features, Cross3D [16], to pursue an efficient yet compact model architecture for the extreme edge. For both the SRP feature representation and neural network, we propose respectively our scalable LC-SRP-Edge and Cross3D-Edge algorithms which are optimized towards lower hardware overhead. LC-SRP-Edge halves the complexity and on-chip memory overhead for the sinc interpolation compared to the original LC-SRP [19]. Over multiple SRP resolution cases, Cross3D-Edge saves 10.32~73.71% computational complexity and 59.77~94.66% neural network weights against the Cross3D baseline. In terms of the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, the most balanced version (EM) requires only 127.1 MFLOPS computation, 3.71 MByte/s bandwidth, and 0.821 MByte on-chip memory in total, while still retaining competitiveness in state-of-the-art accuracy comparisons.

To facilitate this research, we introduce a high-quality benchmark named AVISeg, containing over 90K instance masks from 26 semantic categories in 926 long videos. Additionally, we propose a strong baseline model for this task. Our model first localizes sound source within each frame, and condenses object-specific contexts into concise tokens. Then it builds long-range audio-visual dependencies between these tokens using window-based attention, and tracks sounding objects among the entire video sequences. Extensive experiments reveal that our method performs best on AVISeg, surpassing the existing methods from related tasks. We further conduct the evaluation on several multi-modal large models. Unfortunately, they exhibits subpar performance on instance-level sound source localization and temporal perception. We expect that AVIS will inspire the community towards a more comprehensive multi-modal understanding.

| **[Deep Identification of Propagation Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00646v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding propagation structures in graph diffusion processes, such as epidemic spread or misinformation diffusion, is a fundamental yet challenging problem. While existing methods primarily focus on source localization, they cannot reconstruct the underlying propagation trees i.e., "who infected whom", which are substantial for tracking the propagation pathways and investigate diffusion mechanisms. In this work, we propose Deep Identification of Propagation Trees (DIPT), a probabilistic framework that infers propagation trees from observed diffused states. DIPT models local influence strengths between nodes and leverages an alternating optimization strategy to jointly learn the diffusion mechanism and reconstruct the propagation structure. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of DIPT in accurately reconstructing propagation trees.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast $\ell_1$-Regularized EEG Source Localization Using Variable Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20304v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalograms (EEG) are invaluable for treating neurological disorders, however, mapping EEG electrode readings to brain activity requires solving a challenging inverse problem. Due to the time series data, the use of $\ell_1$ regularization quickly becomes intractable for many solvers, and, despite the reconstruction advantages of $\ell_1$ regularization, $\ell_2$-based approaches such as sLORETA are used in practice. In this work, we formulate EEG source localization as a graphical generalized elastic net inverse problem and present a variable projected algorithm (VPAL) suitable for fast EEG source localization. We prove convergence of this solver for a broad class of separable convex, potentially non-smooth functions subject to linear constraints and include a modification of VPAL that reconstructs time points in sequence, suitable for real-time reconstruction. Our proposed methods are compared to state-of-the-art approaches including sLORETA and other methods for $\ell_1$-regularized inverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative AI Enables EEG Super-Resolution via Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v5)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods predominantly schedule robots' movements based on reactive stimuli or simplified gas plume models. These approaches typically excel in idealized, simulated environments but fall short in real-world gas environments characterized by their patchy distribution. In this work, we introduce SniffySquad, a multi-robot olfaction-based system designed to address the inherent patchiness in gas source localization. SniffySquad incorporates a patchiness-aware active sensing approach that enhances the quality of data collection and estimation. Moreover, it features an innovative collaborative role adaptation strategy to boost the efficiency of source-seeking endeavors. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves an increase in the success rate by $20\%+$ and an improvement in path efficiency by $30\%+$, outperforming state-of-the-art gas source localization solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[AudioSpa: Spatializing Sound Events with Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11219v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-audio (TTA) systems have recently demonstrated strong performance in synthesizing monaural audio from text. However, the task of generating binaural spatial audio from text, which provides a more immersive auditory experience by incorporating the sense of spatiality, have not been explored yet. In this work, we introduce text-guided binaural audio generation. As an early effort, we focus on the scenario where a monaural reference audio is given additionally. The core problem is to associate specific sound events with their directions, thereby creating binaural spatial audio. The challenge lies in the complexity of textual descriptions and the limited availability of single-source sound event datasets. To address this, we propose AudioSpa, an end-to-end model that applies large language models to process both acoustic and textual information. We employ fusion multi-head attention (FMHA) to integrate text tokens, which enhances the generation capability of the multimodal learning. Additionally, we propose a binaural source localization model to assess the quality of the generated audio. Finally, we design a data augmentation strategy to generate diverse datasets, which enables the model to spatialize sound events across various spatial positions. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is able to put sounds at the specified locations accurately. It achieves competitive performance in both localization accuracy and signal distortion. Our demonstrations are available at https://linfeng-feng.github.io/AudioSpa-demo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibration of Multiple Asynchronous Microphone Arrays using Hybrid TDOA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06195v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate calibration of acoustic sensing systems made of multiple asynchronous microphone arrays is essential for satisfactory performance in sound source localization and tracking. State-of-the-art calibration methods for this type of system rely on the time difference of arrival and direction of arrival measurements among the microphone arrays (denoted as TDOA-M and DOA, respectively). In this paper, to enhance calibration accuracy, we propose to incorporate the time difference of arrival measurements between adjacent sound events (TDOAS) with respect to the microphone arrays. More specifically, we propose a two-stage calibration approach, including an initial value estimation (IVE) procedure and the final joint optimization step. The IVE stage first initializes all parameters except for microphone array orientations, using hybrid TDOA (i.e., TDOAM and TDOA-S), odometer data from a moving robot carrying a speaker, and DOA. Subsequently, microphone orientations are estimated through the iterative closest point method. The final joint optimization step estimates multiple microphone array locations, orientations, time offsets, clock drift rates, and sound source locations simultaneously. Both simulation and experiment results show that for scenarios with low or moderate TDOA noise levels, our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy. All code and data are available at https://github.com/AISLABsustech/Hybrid-TDOA-Multi-Calib.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted and is going to be presented at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer significant advantages for RF source localization (RFSL) over terrestrial methods, leveraging autonomous 3D navigation and improved signal capture at higher altitudes. Recent advancements in deep learning (DL) have further enhanced localization accuracy, particularly for outdoor scenarios. DL models often face challenges in real-world performance, as they are typically trained on simulated datasets that fail to replicate real-world conditions fully. To address this, we first propose the Enhanced Two-Ray propagation model, reducing the simulation-to-reality gap by improving the accuracy of propagation environment modeling. For RFSL, we propose the 3D Cluster-Based RealAdaptRNet, a DL-based method leveraging 3D clustering-based feature extraction for robust localization. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Enhanced Two-Ray model provides superior accuracy in simulating real-world propagation scenarios compared to conventional free-space and two-ray models. Notably, the 3D Cluster-Based RealAdaptRNet, trained entirely on simulated datasets, achieves exceptional performance when validated in real-world environments using the AERPAW physical testbed, with an average localization error of 18.2 m. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, utilizing 33.5 times fewer parameters, and demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across diverse trajectories, making it highly suitable for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE ICC 2025</p></details> |

Traditional methods face significant challenges, including partial observability, temporal and spatial dynamics, out-of-distribution generalization, and reward sparsity. To address these issues, we propose a hierarchical framework that integrates Bayesian inference and reinforcement learning. The framework leverages an attention-enhanced particle filtering mechanism for efficient and accurate belief updates, and incorporates two complementary execution strategies: Attention Particle Filtering Planning and Attention Particle Filtering Reinforcement Learning. These approaches optimize exploration and adaptation under uncertainty. Theoretical analysis proves the convergence of the attention-enhanced particle filter, while extensive experiments across diverse scenarios validate the framework's superior accuracy, adaptability, and computational efficiency. Our results highlight the framework's potential for broad applications in dynamic field estimation tasks.</p></details> |  |

As a result, this form of intelligent robotics is capable of performing more complex tasks and achieving more precise results than simpler approaches based on single data sources. However, these improved capabilities come at the cost of higher complexity, both computational and in terms of design. Due to the increased design complexity, formal approaches for exploiting semantic understanding become necessary. We present here a probabilistic formulation for integrating semantic knowledge into the process of gas source localization (GSL). The problem of GSL poses many unsolved challenges, and proposed solutions need to contend with the constraining limitations of sensing hardware. By exploiting semantic scene understanding, we can leverage other sources of information, such as vision, to improve the estimation of the source location. We show how our formulation can be applied to pre-existing GSL algorithms and the effect that including semantic data has on the produced estimations of the location of the source.</p></details> |  |

By employing higher-order Ambisonics, our dataset enables precise spatial audio reproduction, a critical requirement for realistic immersive audio applications. Leveraging the virtual simulation, we present a unique microphone configuration, based on the superposition principle, designed to optimize sound field coverage while addressing the limitations of traditional microphone arrays. The presented 64-microphone configuration allows us to capture RIRs directly in the Spherical Harmonics domain. The dataset features a wide range of room configurations, encompassing variations in room geometry, acoustic absorption materials, and source-receiver distances. A detailed description of the simulation setup is provided alongside for an accurate reproduction. The dataset serves as a vital resource for researchers working on spatial audio, particularly in applications involving machine learning to improve room acoustics modeling and sound field synthesis. It further provides a very high level of spatial resolution and realism crucial for tasks such as source localization, reverberation prediction, and immersive sound reproduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025 Workshop.

Although many complex systems have an asymmetric relational structure, most TDL models forcibly symmetrize these relationships. In this paper, we first introduce a novel notion of higher-order directionality and we then design Directed Simplicial Neural Networks (Dir-SNNs) based on it. Dir-SNNs are message-passing networks operating on directed simplicial complexes able to leverage directed and possibly asymmetric interactions among the simplices. To our knowledge, this is the first TDL model using a notion of higher-order directionality. We theoretically and empirically prove that Dir-SNNs are more expressive than their directed graph counterpart in distinguishing isomorphic directed graphs. Experiments on a synthetic source localization task demonstrate that Dir-SNNs outperform undirected SNNs when the underlying complex is directed, and perform comparably when the underlying complex is undirected.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Estimating the position of the source is influenced by various factors, such as noise and reverberation, leading to significant uncertainty. Quantifying this uncertainty is essential, particularly when localization outcomes impact critical decision-making processes, such as in robot audition, where the accuracy of location estimates directly influences subsequent actions. Despite this, common localization methods offer point estimates without quantifying the estimation uncertainty. To address this, we employ conformal prediction (CP)-a framework that delivers statistically valid prediction intervals (PIs) with finite-sample guarantees, independent of the data distribution. However, commonly used Inductive CP (ICP) methods require a large amount of labeled data, which can be difficult to obtain in the localization setting. To mitigate this limitation, we incorporate a semi-supervised manifold-based localization method using Gaussian process regression (GPR), with an efficient Transductive CP (TCP) technique, specifically designed for GPR. We demonstrate that our method generates statistically valid PIs across different acoustic conditions, while producing smaller intervals compared to baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table.

| **[A Critical Assessment of Visual Sound Source Localization Models Including Negative Audio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01020v3)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Visual Sound Source Localization (VSSL) involves identifying the location of sound sources in visual scenes, integrating audio-visual data for enhanced scene understanding. Despite advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, we observe three critical flaws: i) The evaluation of the models is mainly focused in sounds produced by objects that are visible in the image, ii) The evaluation often assumes a prior knowledge of the size of the sounding object, and iii) No universal threshold for localization in real-world scenarios is established, as previous approaches only consider positive examples without accounting for both positive and negative cases. In this paper, we introduce a novel test set and metrics designed to complete the current standard evaluation of VSSL models by testing them in scenarios where none of the objects in the image corresponds to the audio input, i.e. a negative audio. We consider three types of negative audio: silence, noise and offscreen. Our analysis reveals that numerous SOTA models fail to appropriately adjust their predictions based on audio input, suggesting that these models may not be leveraging audio information as intended. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the range of maximum values in the estimated audio-visual similarity maps, in both positive and negative audio cases, and show that most of the models are not discriminative enough, making them unfit to choose a universal threshold appropriate to perform sound localization without any a priori information of the sounding object, that is, object size and visibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mask-Weighted Spatial Likelihood Coding for Speaker-Independent Joint Localization and Mask Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19595v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their robustness and flexibility, neural-driven beamformers are a popular choice for speech separation in challenging environments with a varying amount of simultaneous speakers alongside noise and reverberation. Time-frequency masks and relative directions of the speakers regarding a fixed spatial grid can be used to estimate the beamformer's parameters. To some degree, speaker-independence is achieved by ensuring a greater amount of spatial partitions than speech sources. In this work, we analyze how to encode both mask and positioning into such a grid to enable joint estimation of both quantities. We propose mask-weighted spatial likelihood coding and show that it achieves considerable performance in both tasks compared to baseline encodings optimized for either localization or mask estimation. In the same setup, we demonstrate superiority for joint estimation of both quantities. Conclusively, we propose a universal approach which can replace an upstream sound source localization system solely by adapting the training framework, making it highly relevant in performance-critical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2025 IEEE.

The audio-visual weak-correlation in such setting poses new challenges in deriving innovative methods to answer if or how we can use cross-modal information to solve the task. Towards this end, we propose to use an acoustic-camera rig consisting of a pinhole RGB-D camera and a coplanar four-channel microphone array~(Mic-Array). By using this rig to record audio-visual signals from multiviews, we can use the cross-modal cues to estimate the sound sources 3D locations. Specifically, our framework SoundLoc3D treats the task as a set prediction problem, each element in the set corresponds to a potential sound source. Given the audio-visual weak-correlation, the set representation is initially learned from a single view microphone array signal, and then refined by actively incorporating physical surface cues revealed from multiview RGB-D images. We demonstrate the efficiency and superiority of SoundLoc3D on large-scale simulated dataset, and further show its robustness to RGB-D measurement inaccuracy and ambient noise interference.</p></details> | Accepted by WACV2025 |

While many species have evolved highly adaptive behavioral responses to such variability, the emerging field of neuromorphic olfaction continues to grapple with the challenge of efficiently sampling and identifying odors in real-time. In this work, we investigate Metal-Oxide (MOx) gas sensor recordings of constant airflow-embedded artificial odor plumes. We discover a data feature that is representative of the presented odor stimulus at a certain concentration - irrespective of temporal variations caused by the plume dynamics. Further, we design a neuromorphic electronic nose front-end circuit for extracting and encoding this feature into analog spikes for gas detection and concentration estimation. The design is inspired by the spiking output of parallel neural pathways in the mammalian olfactory bulb. We test the circuit for gas recognition and concentration estimation in artificial environments, where either single gas pulses or pre-recorded odor plumes were deployed in a constant flow of air. For both environments, our results indicate that the gas concentration is encoded in -- and inversely proportional to the time difference of analog spikes emerging out of two parallel pathways, similar to the spiking output of a mammalian olfactory bulb. The resulting neuromorphic nose could enable data-efficient, real-time robotic plume navigation systems, advancing the capabilities of odor source localization in applications such as environmental monitoring and search-and-rescue.</p></details> |  |

To date, NPE has not been used to perform inference in models with spatially varying covariates. However, ground-based astronomical images have spatially varying sky backgrounds and point spread functions (PSFs), and accounting for this variation is essential for constructing accurate catalogs of imaged light sources. In this work, we introduce a method of performing NPE with spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs. In this method, we generate synthetic catalogs and semi-synthetic images for these catalogs using randomly sampled PSF and background estimates from existing surveys. Using this data, we train a neural network, which takes an astronomical image and representations of its background and PSF as input, to output a probabilistic catalog. Our experiments with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data demonstrate the effectiveness of NPE in the presence of spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs for light source detection, star/galaxy separation, and flux measurement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Astronomical Journal</p></details> |

Due to the limited computational resources available on UAVs, large models cannot be run independently for real-time analysis. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight and efficient two-stage framework for real-time wildfire monitoring and fire source detection on UAV platforms. Specifically, in Stage 1, we utilize a policy network to identify and discard redundant video clips using frame compression techniques, thereby reducing computational costs. In addition, we introduce a station point mechanism that leverages future frame information within the sequential policy network to improve prediction accuracy. In Stage 2, once the frame is classified as "fire", we employ the improved YOLOv8 model to localize the fire source. We evaluate the Stage 1 method using the FLAME and HMDB51 datasets, and the Stage 2 method using the Fire & Smoke dataset. Experimental results show that our method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining classification accuracy in Stage 1, and achieves higher detection accuracy with similar inference time in Stage 2 compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Algorithms for SD help us combat diseases, misinformation, pollution, and more, and have been studied by physicians, physicists, sociologists, and computer scientists. The field has received considerable attention and been analyzed in many settings (e.g., under different models of spreading processes), yet all previous work shares the same assumption that the network the spreading process takes place in has the same structure at every point in time. For example, if we consider how a disease spreads through a population, it is unrealistic to assume that two people can either never or at every time infect each other, rather such an infection is possible precisely when they meet. Therefore, we propose an extended model of SD based on temporal graphs, where each link between two nodes is only present at some time step. Temporal graphs have become a standard model of time-varying graphs, and, recently, researchers have begun to study infection problems (such as influence maximization) on temporal graphs (arXiv:2303.11703, [Gayraud et al., 2015]). We give the first formalization of SD on temporal graphs. For this, we employ the standard SIR model of spreading processes ([Hethcote, 1989]). We give both lower bounds and algorithms for the SD problem in a number of different settings, such as with consistent or dynamic source behavior and on general graphs as well as on trees.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is based on the first author's master thesis, which is available at arXiv:2503.13567</p></details> |

To defend against such attacks, recent studies have developed various detection mechanisms. If we restrict ourselves specifically to works which perform detection rather than direct defense, most of them focus on direct prompt injection attacks, while there are few works for the indirect scenario, where injected instructions are indirectly from external tools, such as a search engine. Moreover, current works mainly investigate injection detection methods and pay less attention to the post-processing method that aims to mitigate the injection after detection. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of detecting and removing indirect prompt injection attacks, and we construct a benchmark dataset for evaluation. For detection, we assess the performance of existing LLMs and open-source detection models, and we further train detection models using our crafted training datasets. For removal, we evaluate two intuitive methods: (1) the segmentation removal method, which segments the injected document and removes parts containing injected instructions, and (2) the extraction removal method, which trains an extraction model to identify and remove injected instructions.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main |

In particular, endoscopists have to repeatedly flush to clear blood, allowing only milliseconds to identify bleeding sources, an inefficient process that prolongs operations and elevates patient risks. However, current Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods primarily focus on bleeding region segmentation, overlooking the critical need for accurate bleeding source detection and temporal tracking in the challenging ESD environment, which is marked by frequent visual obstructions and dynamic scene changes. This gap is widened by the lack of specialized datasets, hindering the development of robust AI-assisted guidance systems. To address these challenges, we introduce BleedOrigin-Bench, the first comprehensive ESD bleeding source dataset, featuring 1,771 expert-annotated bleeding sources across 106,222 frames from 44 procedures, supplemented with 39,755 pseudo-labeled frames. This benchmark covers 8 anatomical sites and 6 challenging clinical scenarios. We also present BleedOrigin-Net, a novel dual-stage detection-tracking framework for the bleeding source localization in ESD procedures, addressing the complete workflow from bleeding onset detection to continuous spatial tracking. We compare with widely-used object detection models (YOLOv11/v12), multimodal large language models, and point tracking methods. Extensive evaluation demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving 96.85% frame-level accuracy ($\pm\leq8$ frames) for bleeding onset detection, 70.24% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for initial source detection, and 96.11% pixel-level accuracy ($\leq100$ px) for point tracking.</p></details> | 27 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Enforcing Speech Content Privacy in Environmental Sound Recordings using Segment-wise Waveform Reversal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08412v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental sound recordings often contain intelligible speech, raising privacy concerns that limit analysis, sharing and reuse of data. In this paper, we introduce a method that renders speech unintelligible while preserving both the integrity of the acoustic scene, and the overall audio quality. Our approach involves reversing waveform segments to distort speech content. This process is enhanced through a voice activity detection and speech separation pipeline, which allows for more precise targeting of speech. In order to demonstrate the effectivness of the proposed approach, we consider a three-part evaluation protocol that assesses: 1) speech intelligibility using Word Error Rate (WER), 2) sound sources detectability using Sound source Classification Accuracy-Drop (SCAD) from a widely used pre-trained model, and 3) audio quality using the Fr\'echet Audio Distance (FAD), computed with our reference dataset that contains unaltered speech. Experiments on this simulated evaluation dataset, which consists of linear mixtures of speech and environmental sound scenes, show that our method achieves satisfactory speech intelligibility reduction (97.9% WER), minimal degradation of the sound sources detectability (2.7% SCAD), and high perceptual quality (FAD of 1.40). An ablation study further highlights the contribution of each component of the pipeline. We also show that incorporating random splicing to our speech content privacy enforcement method can enhance the algorithm's robustness to attempt to recover the clean speech, at a slight cost of audio quality.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often focus on single sources, whereas real-world scenarios frequently involve multiple sources, complicating detection efforts. This study addresses the multiple-source detection (MSD) problem by integrating edge clustering algorithms into the community-based label propagation framework, effectively handling mixed-membership issues where nodes belong to multiple communities. The proposed approach applies the automated latent space edge clustering model to a network, partitioning infected networks into edge-based clusters to identify multiple sources. Simulation studies on ADD HEALTH social network datasets demonstrate that this method achieves superior accuracy, as measured by the F1-Measure, compared to state-of-the-art clustering algorithms. The results highlight the robustness of edge clustering in accurately detecting sources, particularly in networks with complex and overlapping source regions.

| **[Source Detection in Hypergraph Epidemic Dynamics using a Higher-Order Dynamic Message Passing Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02523v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source detection is crucial for capturing the dynamics of real-world infectious diseases and informing effective containment strategies. Most existing approaches to source detection focus on conventional pairwise networks, whereas recent efforts on both mathematical modeling and analysis of contact data suggest that higher-order (e.g., group) interactions among individuals may both account for a large fraction of infection events and change our understanding of how epidemic spreading proceeds in empirical populations. In the present study, we propose a message-passing algorithm, called the HDMPN, for source detection for a stochastic susceptible-infectious dynamics on hypergraphs. By modulating the likelihood maximization method by the fraction of infectious neighbors, HDMPN aims to capture the influence of higher-order structures and do better than the conventional likelihood maximization. We numerically show that, in most cases, HDMPN outperforms benchmarks including the likelihood maximization method without modification.</p></details> |  |

Despite advances in machine learning-based methods, many fail to capture intrinsic dynamics of rumor propagation. In this work, we present SourceDetMamba: A Graph-aware State Space Model for Source Detection in Sequential Hypergraphs, which harnesses the recent success of the state space model Mamba, known for its superior global modeling capabilities and computational efficiency, to address this challenge. Specifically, we first employ hypergraphs to model high-order interactions within social networks. Subsequently, temporal network snapshots generated during the propagation process are sequentially fed in reverse order into Mamba to infer underlying propagation dynamics. Finally, to empower the sequential model to effectively capture propagation patterns while integrating structural information, we propose a novel graph-aware state update mechanism, wherein the state of each node is propagated and refined by both temporal dependencies and topological context. Extensive evaluations on eight datasets demonstrate that SourceDetMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI25 |

Existing approaches in rumor source detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study, we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion. Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach, showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI25 |
| **[Replay Attacks Against Audio Deepfake Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14862v2)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show how replay attacks undermine audio deepfake detection: By playing and re-recording deepfake audio through various speakers and microphones, we make spoofed samples appear authentic to the detection model. To study this phenomenon in more detail, we introduce ReplayDF, a dataset of recordings derived from M-AILABS and MLAAD, featuring 109 speaker-microphone combinations across six languages and four TTS models. It includes diverse acoustic conditions, some highly challenging for detection. Our analysis of six open-source detection models across five datasets reveals significant vulnerability, with the top-performing W2V2-AASIST model's Equal Error Rate (EER) surging from 4.7% to 18.2%. Even with adaptive Room Impulse Response (RIR) retraining, performance remains compromised with an 11.0% EER. We release ReplayDF for non-commercial research use.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced RMT estimator for signal number estimation in the presence of colored noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12942v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The subspace-based techniques are widely utilized in various scientific fields, and they need accurate estimation of the signal subspace dimension. The classic RMT estimator for model order estimation based on random matrix theory assumes that the noise is white Gaussian, and performs poorly in the presence of colored noise with unknown covariance matrix. In the presence of colored noise, the multivariate regression (MV-R) algorithm models the source detection as a multivariate regression problem and infers the model order from the covariance matrix of the residual error. However, the MV-R algorithm requires that the noise is sufficiently weaker than the signal. In order to deal with these problems, this paper proposes a novel signal number estimation algorithm in the presence of colored noise based on the analysis of the behavior of information theoretic criteria. Firstly, a first criterion is defined as the ratio of the current eigenvalue and the mean of the next ones, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Moreover, a second criterion is designed as the ratio of the current value and the next value of the first criterion, and its properties is analyzed with respect to the over-modeling and under-modeling. Then, a novel enhanced RMT estimator is proposed for signal number estimation by analyzing the detection properties among the signal number estimates obtained by these two criteria, the MV-R estimator and the RMT estimator to sequentially determine whether the eigenvalue being tested is arising from a signal or from noise. Finally, simulation results are presented to illustrate that the proposed enhanced RMT estimator has better estimation performance than the existing methods.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Transfer Learning Under High-Dimensional Network Convolutional Regression Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19979v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transfer learning enhances model performance by utilizing knowledge from related domains, particularly when labeled data is scarce. While existing research addresses transfer learning under various distribution shifts in independent settings, handling dependencies in networked data remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a high-dimensional transfer learning framework based on network convolutional regression (NCR), inspired by the success of graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The NCR model incorporates random network structure by allowing each node's response to depend on its features and the aggregated features of its neighbors, capturing local dependencies effectively. Our methodology includes a two-step transfer learning algorithm that addresses domain shift between source and target networks, along with a source detection mechanism to identify informative domains. Theoretically, we analyze the lasso estimator in the context of a random graph based on the Erdos-Renyi model assumption, demonstrating that transfer learning improves convergence rates when informative sources are present. Empirical evaluations, including simulations and a real-world application using Sina Weibo data, demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy, particularly when labeled data in the target domain is limited.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional heuristic or machine learning approaches that rely on static features and struggle to adapt to evolving threats, or deep learning models that are computationally intensive, our approach utilizes MobileBERT, a fast and memory-efficient variant of the BERT architecture, to capture nuanced features indicative of phishing attacks. To further enhance detection accuracy, PhishLang employs a multi-modal ensemble approach, combining both the URL and Source detection models. This architecture ensures robustness by allowing one model to compensate for scenarios where the other may fail, or if both models provide ambiguous inferences. As a result, PhishLang excels at detecting both regular and evasive phishing threats, including zero-day attacks, outperforming popular anti-phishing tools, while operating without relying on external blocklists and safeguarding user privacy by ensuring that browser history remains entirely local and unshared. We release PhishLang as a Chromium browser extension and also open-source the framework to aid the research community.</p></details> |  |

To address data limitations in studying MSSA sepsis, we extend existing transfer learning frameworks to accommodate transformation models for high-dimensional survival data. Specifically, we construct a measurement index based on C-index for intelligently identifying the helpful source datasets, and the target model performance is improved by leveraging information from the identified source datasets via performing the transfer step and debiasing step. We further provide an algorithm to construct confidence intervals for each coefficient component. Another significant development is that statistical properties are rigorously established, including $\ell_1/\ell_2$-estimation error bounds of the transfer learning algorithm, detection consistency property of the transferable source detection algorithm and asymptotic theories for the confidence interval construction. Extensive simulations and analysis of MIMIC-IV sepsis data demonstrate the estimation and prediction accuracy, and practical advantages of our approach, providing significant improvements in survival estimates for MSSA sepsis patients.</p></details> |  |

Traditional models, such as Susceptible-Infected-Recovered, and graph-based approaches often fail to account for higher-order interactions and the nuanced structure pattern inherent in human contact networks. This study introduces a novel Human Contact-Tracing Hypergraph Neural Network framework tailored for epidemic modeling called EpiDHGNN, leveraging the capabilities of hypergraphs to model intricate, higher-order relationships from both location and individual level. Both real-world and synthetic epidemic data are used to train and evaluate the model. Results demonstrate that EpiDHGNN consistently outperforms baseline models across various epidemic modeling tasks, such as source detection and forecast, by effectively capturing the higher-order interactions and preserving the complex structure of human interactions. This work underscores the potential of representing human contact data as hypergraphs and employing hypergraph-based methods to improve epidemic modeling, providing reliable insights for public health decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Visualizing Privacy-Relevant Data Flows in Android Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16640v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Android applications collecting data from users must protect it according to the current legal frameworks. Such data protection has become even more important since in 2018 the European Union rolled out the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since app developers are not legal experts, they find it difficult to integrate privacy-aware practices into source code development. Despite these legal obligations, developers have limited tool support to reason about data protection throughout their app development process. This paper explores the use of static program slicing and software visualization to analyze privacy-relevant data flows in Android apps. We introduce SliceViz, a web tool that analyzes an Android app by slicing all privacy-relevant data sources detected in the source code on the back-end. It then helps developers by visualizing these privacy-relevant program slices. We conducted a user study with 12 participants demonstrating that SliceViz effectively aids developers in identifying privacy-relevant properties in Android apps. Our findings indicate that program slicing can be employed to identify and reason about privacy-relevant data flows in Android applications. With further usability improvements, developers can be better equipped to handle privacy-sensitive information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Discovery and Source Detection in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13567v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Researchers, policy makers, and engineers need to make sense of data on spreading processes as diverse as viral infections, water contamination, and misinformation in social networks. Classical questions include predicting infection behavior in a given network or deducing the structure of a network from infection data. We study two central problems in this area. In graph discovery, we aim to fully reconstruct the structure of a graph from infection data. In source detection, we observe a limited subset of the infections and aim to deduce the source of the infection chain. These questions have received considerable attention and have been analyzed in many settings (e.g., under different models of spreading processes), yet all previous work shares the assumption that the network has the same structure at every point in time. For example, if we consider how a disease spreads, it is unrealistic to assume that two people can either never or always infect each other, rather such an infection is possible precisely when they meet. Temporal graphs, in which connections change over time, have recently been used as a more realistic graph model to study infections. Despite this recent attention, we are the first to study graph discovery or source detection in temporal graphs. We propose models for temporal graph discovery and source detection that are consistent with previous work on static graphs and extend it to embrace the stronger expressiveness of temporal graphs. For this, we employ the standard susceptible-infected-resistant model of spreading processes, which is particularly often used to study diseases. We provide algorithms, lower bounds, and some experimental evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is my Master's thesis submitted at the Digital Engineering Faculty of the University of Potsdam on September 30, 2024.

| **[Image Pre-Processing Framework for Time-Domain Astronomy in the Artificial Intelligence Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10783v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of image analysis methods in time-domain astronomy, particularly those leveraging AI algorithms, has highlighted efficient image pre-processing as a critical bottleneck affecting algorithm performance. Image pre-processing, which involves standardizing images for training or deployment of various AI algorithms, encompasses essential steps such as image quality evaluation, alignment, stacking, background extraction, gray-scale transformation, cropping, source detection, astrometry, and photometry. Historically, these algorithms were developed independently by different research groups, primarily based on CPU architecture for small-scale data processing. This paper introduces a novel framework for image pre-processing that integrates key algorithms specifically modified for GPU architecture, enabling large-scale image pre-processing for different algorithms. To prepare for the new algorithm design paradigm in the AI era, we have implemented two operational modes in the framework for different application scenarios: Eager mode and Pipeline mode. The Eager mode facilitates real-time feedback and flexible adjustments, which could be used for parameter tuning and algorithm development. The pipeline mode is primarily designed for large scale data processing, which could be used for training or deploying of artificial intelligence models. We have tested the performance of our framework using simulated and real observation images. Results demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances image pre-processing speed while maintaining accuracy levels comparable to CPU based algorithms. To promote accessibility and ease of use, a Docker version of our framework is available for download in the PaperData Repository powered by China-VO, compatible with various AI algorithms developed for time-domain astronomy research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AJ.

Cross-checking the GNSS-provided time against alternative multiple trusted time sources can lead to attack detection aiming at controlling the GNSS receiver time. Leveraging external, network-connected secure time providers and onboard clock references, we achieve detection even under fine-grained time attacks. We provide an extensive evaluation of our multi-layered defense against adversaries mounting attacks against the GNSS receiver along with controlling the network link. We implement adversaries spanning from simplistic spoofers to advanced ones synchronized with the GNSS constellation. We demonstrate attack detection is possible in all tested cases (sharp discontinuity, smooth take-over, and coordinated network manipulation) without changes to the structure of the GNSS receiver. Leveraging the diversity of the reference time sources, detection of take-over time push as low as 150us is possible. Smooth take-overs forcing variations as low as 30ns are also detected based on on-board precision oscillators. The method (and thus the evaluation) is largely agnostic to the satellite constellation and the attacker type, making time-based data validation of GNSS information compatible with existing receivers and readily deployable.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems (Early Access)</p></details> |

Prior work in this area focuses on massive MIMO scenarios, which are typically characterized by full-rank channels, and fail in low-rank channel scenarios. The proposed algorithm outperforms existing methods in joint source-channel estimation, especially in low-rank scenarios where the number of users exceeds the number of antennas at the access point (AP). The proposed score-based iterative diffusion process estimates the gradient of the prior distribution on partial channels, and recursively updates the estimated channel parts as well as the source. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the baseline methods in terms of normalized mean squared error (NMSE) and symbol error rate (SER) in both full-rank and low-rank channel scenarios, while having a more dominant effect in the latter, at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNR).</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at IEEE ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

In this situation, it can become increasingly difficult to discern what information is false or true. If false information proliferates significantly, it can lead to undesirable outcomes. Hence, when we receive some information, we can pose the following two questions: $(i)$ Is the information true? $(ii)$ If not, who initially spread that information? % The first problem is the rumor detection issue, while the second is the rumor source detection problem. A rumor-detection problem involves identifying and mitigating false or misleading information spread via various communication channels, particularly online platforms and social media. Rumors can range from harmless ones to deliberately misleading content aimed at deceiving or manipulating audiences. Detecting misinformation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of information ecosystems and preventing harmful effects such as the spread of false beliefs, polarization, and even societal harm. Therefore, it is very important to quickly distinguish such misinformation while simultaneously finding its source to block it from spreading on the network. However, most of the existing surveys have analyzed these two issues separately. In this work, we first survey the existing research on the rumor-detection and rumor source detection problems with joint detection approaches, simultaneously. % This survey deals with these two issues together so that their relationship can be observed and it provides how the two problems are similar and different. The limitations arising from the rumor detection, rumor source detection, and their combination problems are also explained, and some challenges to be addressed in future works are presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transfer Learning for High-dimensional Quantile Regression with Distribution Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19933v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information from related source studies can often enhance the findings of a target study. However, the distribution shift between target and source studies can severely impact the efficiency of knowledge transfer. In the high-dimensional regression setting, existing transfer approaches mainly focus on the parameter shift. In this paper, we focus on the high-dimensional quantile regression with knowledge transfer under three types of distribution shift: parameter shift, covariate shift, and residual shift. We propose a novel transferable set and a new transfer framework to address the above three discrepancies. Non-asymptotic estimation error bounds and source detection consistency are established to validate the availability and superiority of our method in the presence of distribution shift. Additionally, an orthogonal debiased approach is proposed for statistical inference with knowledge transfer, leading to sharper asymptotic results. Extensive simulation results as well as real data applications further demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed procedure.</p></details> | 53 pages |

These reactors will generate a large flow of information in the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition, these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems, additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e., detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1 with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added references, corrected typos, grammar check, authors updated</p></details> |

However, in practical monitoring data, the proportion of high-emission state data is significantly lower compared to normal emission states. This characteristic long-tailed distribution severely impedes the extraction of discriminative features for emission state identification during data mining. Furthermore, the highly nonlinear nature of vehicle emission states and the lack of relevant prior knowledge also pose significant challenges to the construction of identification models.To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Set-Valued Transformer Network (SVTN) to achieve comprehensive learning of discriminative features from high-emission samples, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. Specifically, this model first employs the transformer to measure the temporal similarity of micro-trip condition variations, thus constructing a mapping rule that projects the original high-dimensional emission data into a low-dimensional feature space. Next, a set-valued identification algorithm is used to probabilistically model the relationship between the generated feature vectors and their labels, providing an accurate metric criterion for the classification algorithm. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments on the diesel vehicle monitoring data of Hefei city in 2020. The results demonstrate that our method achieves a 9.5\% reduction in the missed detection rate for high-emission vehicles compared to the transformer-based baseline, highlighting its superior capability in accurately identifying high-emission mobile pollution sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Horizontal and Vertical Federated Causal Structure Learning via Higher-order Cumulants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06888v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated causal discovery aims to uncover the causal relationships between entities while protecting data privacy, which has significant importance and numerous applications in real-world scenarios. Existing federated causal structure learning methods primarily focus on horizontal federated settings. However, in practical situations, different clients may not necessarily contain data on the same variables. In a single client, the incomplete set of variables can easily lead to spurious causal relationships, thereby affecting the information transmitted to other clients. To address this issue, we comprehensively consider causal structure learning methods under both horizontal and vertical federated settings. We provide the identification theories and methods for learning causal structure in the horizontal and vertical federal setting via higher-order cumulants. Specifically, we first aggregate higher-order cumulant information from all participating clients to construct global cumulant estimates. These global estimates are then used for recursive source identification, ultimately yielding a global causal strength matrix. Our approach not only enables the reconstruction of causal graphs but also facilitates the estimation of causal strength coefficients. Our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real-world data.</p></details> |  |

Departing from classical Tikhonov regularization, we propose a novel approach based on moment analysis of the heat flow, transforming the problem into a more stable inverse moment formulation. By evolving the measured terminal time moments backward through their governing ODE system, we recover the moments of the initial distribution. We then reconstruct the source by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of a measure subject to these moment constraints. This formulation naturally promotes sparsity, yielding atomic solutions that are sums of Dirac measures. Compared to existing methods, our moment-based approach reduces exponential error growth to polynomial growth with respect to the terminal time. We provide explicit error estimates on the recovered initial distributions in terms of moment order, terminal time, and measurement errors. In addition, we develop efficient numerical discretization schemes and demonstrate significant stability improvements of our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments.</p></details> | 30 pages |

In this article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly improve processing speed.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability, modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs, and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction at scale.</p></details> |  |

| **[Distributed Multi-robot Source Seeking in Unknown Environments with Unknown Number of Sources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11048v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel distributed source seeking framework, DIAS, designed for multi-robot systems in scenarios where the number of sources is unknown and potentially exceeds the number of robots. Traditional robotic source seeking methods typically focused on directing each robot to a specific strong source and may fall short in comprehensively identifying all potential sources. DIAS addresses this gap by introducing a hybrid controller that identifies the presence of sources and then alternates between exploration for data gathering and exploitation for guiding robots to identified sources. It further enhances search efficiency by dividing the environment into Voronoi cells and approximating source density functions based on Gaussian process regression. Additionally, DIAS can be integrated with existing source seeking algorithms. We compare DIAS with existing algorithms, including DoSS and GMES in simulated gas leakage scenarios where the number of sources outnumbers or is equal to the number of robots. The numerical results show that DIAS outperforms the baseline methods in both the efficiency of source identification by the robots and the accuracy of the estimated environmental density function.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Real-time Pollutant Identification through Optical PM Micro-Sensor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10724v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air pollution remains one of the most pressing environmental challenges of the modern era, significantly impacting human health, ecosystems, and climate. While traditional air quality monitoring systems provide critical data, their high costs and limited spatial coverage hinder effective real-time pollutant identification. Recent advancements in micro-sensor technology have improved data collection but still lack efficient methods for source identification. This paper explores the innovative application of machine learning (ML) models to classify pollutants in real-time using only data from optical micro-sensors. We propose a novel classification framework capable of distinguishing between four pollutant scenarios: Background Pollution, Ash, Sand, and Candle. Three Machine Learning (ML) approaches - XGBoost, Long Short-Term Memory networks, and Hidden Markov Chains - are evaluated for their effectiveness in sequence modeling and pollutant identification. Our results demonstrate the potential of leveraging micro-sensors and ML techniques to enhance air quality monitoring, offering actionable insights for urban planning and environmental protection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Detecting such images and identifying their source models has become a critical challenge in ensuring the integrity of digital media. This paper tackles the detection of AI-generated images and identifying their source models using CNN and CLIP-ViT classifiers. For the CNN-based classifier, we leverage EfficientNet-B0 as the backbone and feed with RGB channels, frequency features, and reconstruction errors, while for CLIP-ViT, we adopt a pretrained CLIP image encoder to extract image features and SVM to perform classification. Evaluated on the Defactify 4 dataset, our methods demonstrate strong performance in both tasks, with CLIP-ViT showing superior robustness to image perturbations. Compared to baselines like AEROBLADE and OCC-CLIP, our approach achieves competitive results. Notably, our method ranked Top-3 overall in the Defactify 4 competition, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability. All of our implementations can be found in https://github.com/uuugaga/Defactify_4</p></details> |  |
| **[Rapid Parameter Inference with Uncertainty Quantification for a Radiological Plume Source Identification Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17492v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the event of a nuclear accident, or the detonation of a radiological dispersal device, quickly locating the source of the accident or blast is important for emergency response and environmental decontamination. At a specified time after a simulated instantaneous release of an aerosolized radioactive contaminant, measurements are recorded downwind from an array of radiation sensors. Neural networks are employed to infer the source release parameters in an accurate and rapid manner using sensor and mean wind speed data. We consider two neural network constructions that quantify the uncertainty of the predicted values; a categorical classification neural network and a Bayesian neural network. With the categorical classification neural network, we partition the spatial domain and treat each partition as a separate class for which we estimate the probability that it contains the true source location. In a Bayesian neural network, the weights and biases have a distribution rather than a single optimal value. With each evaluation, these distributions are sampled, yielding a different prediction with each evaluation. The trained Bayesian neural network is thus evaluated to construct posterior densities for the release parameters. Results are compared to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) results found using the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis Algorithm. The Bayesian neural network approach is generally much cheaper computationally than the MCMC approach as it relies on the computational cost of the neural network evaluation to generate posterior densities as opposed to the MCMC approach which depends on the computational expense of the transport and radiation detection models.</p></details> |  |

Despite their therapeutic importance, these products can aggregate and form subvisible particles (SvPs), which can compromise their efficacy and trigger immunological responses, emphasizing the critical need for robust monitoring techniques. Flow Imaging Microscopy (FIM) has been a significant advancement in detecting SvPs, evolving from monochrome to more recently incorporating color imaging. Complementing SvP images obtained via FIM, deep learning techniques have recently been employed successfully for stress source identification of monochrome SvPs. In this study, we explore the potential of color FIM to enhance the characterization of stress sources in SvPs. To achieve this, we curate a new dataset comprising 16,000 SvPs from eight commercial monoclonal antibodies subjected to heat and mechanical stress. Using both supervised and self-supervised convolutional neural networks, as well as vision transformers in large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that deep learning with color FIM images consistently outperforms monochrome images, thus highlighting the potential of color FIM in stress source classification compared to its monochrome counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in MICCAI 2024 Workshop on Medical Optical Imaging and Virtual Microscopy Image Analysis (MOVI)</p></details> |

We establish the well-posedness of the direct problem in the sense of transposition and improved local regularity. Using classical unique continuation of the subdiffusion model and improved local solution regularity, we prove the uniqueness of simultaneously recovering the locations of point sources, time-dependent strengths and initial condition for both one- and multi-dimensional cases. Moreover, in the one-dimensional case, the elliptic operator can have time-dependent coefficients. These results extend existing studies on point source identification for parabolic type problems. Additionally we present several numerical experiments to show the feasibility of numerical reconstruction.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Humans, however, are inaccurate in localizing sound cues, especially with multiple sources due to limitations in human auditory perception such as angular discrimination error and front-back confusion. This decreases the efficiency of XR interfaces because users misidentify from which XR element a sound is coming. To address this, we propose Auptimize, a novel computational approach for placing XR sound sources, which mitigates such localization errors by utilizing the ventriloquist effect. Auptimize disentangles the sound source locations from the visual elements and relocates the sound sources to optimal positions for unambiguous identification of sound cues, avoiding errors due to inter-source proximity and front-back confusion. Our evaluation shows that Auptimize decreases spatial audio-based source identification errors compared to playing sound cues at the paired visual-sound locations. We demonstrate the applicability of Auptimize for diverse spatial audio-based interactive XR scenarios.</p></details> | UIST 2024 |

However, there is still a lack of neural network-based methods for point source identification, mainly due to the inherent solution singularity. In this work, we develop a novel algorithm to identify point sources, utilizing a neural network combined with a singularity enrichment technique. We employ the fundamental solution and neural networks to represent the singular and regular parts, respectively, and then minimize an empirical loss involving the intensities and locations of the unknown point sources, as well as the parameters of the neural network. Moreover, by combining the conditional stability argument of the inverse problem with the generalization error of the empirical loss, we conduct a rigorous error analysis of the algorithm. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with several challenging experiments.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Causal Discovery of Linear Non-Gaussian Causal Models with Unobserved Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04907v1)** | 2024-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider linear non-Gaussian structural equation models that involve latent confounding. In this setting, the causal structure is identifiable, but, in general, it is not possible to identify the specific causal effects. Instead, a finite number of different causal effects result in the same observational distribution. Most existing algorithms for identifying these causal effects use overcomplete independent component analysis (ICA), which often suffers from convergence to local optima. Furthermore, the number of latent variables must be known a priori. To address these issues, we propose an algorithm that operates recursively rather than using overcomplete ICA. The algorithm first infers a source, estimates the effect of the source and its latent parents on their descendants, and then eliminates their influence from the data. For both source identification and effect size estimation, we use rank conditions on matrices formed from higher-order cumulants. We prove asymptotic correctness under the mild assumption that locally, the number of latent variables never exceeds the number of observed variables. Simulation studies demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to overcomplete ICA even though it does not know the number of latents in advance.</p></details> |  |

The resulting ADMM-PINNs algorithmic framework substantially enlarges the applicable range of PINNs to nonsmooth cases of PDE-constrained optimization problems. The application of the ADMM makes it possible to untie the PDE constraints and the nonsmooth regularization terms for iterations. Accordingly, at each iteration, one of the resulting subproblems is a smooth PDE-constrained optimization which can be efficiently solved by PINNs, and the other is a simple nonsmooth optimization problem which usually has a closed-form solution or can be efficiently solved by various standard optimization algorithms or pre-trained neural networks. The ADMM-PINNs algorithmic framework does not require to solve PDEs repeatedly, and it is mesh-free, easy to implement, and scalable to different PDE settings. We validate the efficiency of the ADMM-PINNs algorithmic framework by different prototype applications, including inverse potential problems, source identification in elliptic equations, control constrained optimal control of the Burgers equation, and sparse optimal control of parabolic equations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Identifying the Source of Generation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12846v1)** | 2024-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) memorize text from several sources of documents. In pretraining, LLM trains to maximize the likelihood of text but neither receives the source of the text nor memorizes the source. Accordingly, LLM can not provide document information on the generated content, and users do not obtain any hint of reliability, which is crucial for factuality or privacy infringement. This work introduces token-level source identification in the decoding step, which maps the token representation to the reference document. We propose a bi-gram source identifier, a multi-layer perceptron with two successive token representations as input for better generalization. We conduct extensive experiments on Wikipedia and PG19 datasets with several LLMs, layer locations, and identifier sizes. The overall results show a possibility of token-level source identifiers for tracing the document, a crucial problem for the safe use of LLMs.</p></details> | ICPRAI 2024 |
| **[A novel shape optimization approach for source identification in elliptic equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02909v1)** | 2024-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel shape optimization approach for the source identification of elliptic equations. This identification problem arises from two application backgrounds: actuator placement in PDE-constrained optimal controls and the regularized least-squares formulation of source identifications. The optimization problem seeks both the source strength and its support. By eliminating the variable associated with the source strength, we reduce the problem to a shape optimization problem for a coupled elliptic system, known as the first-order optimality system. As a model problem, we derive the shape derivative for the regularized least-squares formulation of the inverse source problem and propose a gradient descent shape optimization algorithm, implemented using the level-set method. Several numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Landscape More Secure Than Portrait? Zooming Into the Directionality of Digital Images With Security Implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15206v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The orientation in which a source image is captured can affect the resulting security in downstream applications. One reason for this is that many state-of-the-art methods in media security assume that image statistics are similar in the horizontal and vertical directions, allowing them to reduce the number of features (or trainable weights) by merging coefficients. We show that this artificial symmetrization tends to suppress important properties of natural images and common processing operations, causing a loss of performance. We also observe the opposite problem, where unaddressed directionality causes learning-based methods to overfit to a single orientation. These are vulnerable to manipulation if an adversary chooses inputs with the less common orientation. This paper takes a comprehensive approach, identifies and systematizes causes of directionality at several stages of a typical acquisition pipeline, measures their effect, and demonstrates for three selected security applications (steganalysis, forensic source identification, and the detection of synthetic images) how the performance of state-of-the-art methods can be improved by properly accounting for directionality.</p></details> |  |
| **[DREW : Towards Robust Data Provenance by Leveraging Error-Controlled Watermarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02836v2)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying the origin of data is crucial for data provenance, with applications including data ownership protection, media forensics, and detecting AI-generated content. A standard approach involves embedding-based retrieval techniques that match query data with entries in a reference dataset. However, this method is not robust against benign and malicious edits. To address this, we propose Data Retrieval with Error-corrected codes and Watermarking (DREW). DREW randomly clusters the reference dataset, injects unique error-controlled watermark keys into each cluster, and uses these keys at query time to identify the appropriate cluster for a given sample. After locating the relevant cluster, embedding vector similarity retrieval is performed within the cluster to find the most accurate matches. The integration of error control codes (ECC) ensures reliable cluster assignments, enabling the method to perform retrieval on the entire dataset in case the ECC algorithm cannot detect the correct cluster with high confidence. This makes DREW maintain baseline performance, while also providing opportunities for performance improvements due to the increased likelihood of correctly matching queries to their origin when performing retrieval on a smaller subset of the dataset. Depending on the watermark technique used, DREW can provide substantial improvements in retrieval accuracy (up to 40\% for some datasets and modification types) across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art embedding models (e.g., DinoV2, CLIP), making our method a promising solution for secure and reliable source identification.

Notably, source attribution of synthesized speech has value in forensics and intellectual property protection, but prior work in this area has certain limitations in scope. To address the gaps, we present our findings concerning the identification of the sources of synthesized speech in this paper. We investigate the existence of speech synthesis model fingerprints in the generated speech waveforms, with a focus on the acoustic model and the vocoder, and study the influence of each component on the fingerprint in the overall speech waveforms. Our research, conducted using the multi-speaker LibriTTS dataset, demonstrates two key insights: (1) vocoders and acoustic models impart distinct, model-specific fingerprints on the waveforms they generate, and (2) vocoder fingerprints are the more dominant of the two, and may mask the fingerprints from the acoustic model. These findings strongly suggest the existence of model-specific fingerprints for both the acoustic model and the vocoder, highlighting their potential utility in source identification applications.</p></details> | Accepted by CCL 2024 |

However, many existing watermarking methods, particularly content-agnostic approaches that embed fixed patterns regardless of image content, are vulnerable to steganalysis attacks that can extract and remove the watermark with minimal perceptual distortion. In this work, we categorize watermarking algorithms into content-adaptive and content-agnostic ones, and demonstrate how averaging a collection of watermarked images could reveal the underlying watermark pattern. We then leverage this extracted pattern for effective watermark removal under both graybox and blackbox settings, even when the collection contains multiple watermark patterns. For some algorithms like Tree-Ring watermarks, the extracted pattern can also forge convincing watermarks on clean images. Our quantitative and qualitative evaluations across twelve watermarking methods highlight the threat posed by steganalysis to content-agnostic watermarks and the importance of designing watermarking techniques resilient to such analytical attacks. We propose security guidelines calling for using content-adaptive watermarking strategies and performing security evaluation against steganalysis. We also suggest multi-key assignments as potential mitigations against steganalysis vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |

DAGs can be used to model causal relationships among variables, but their nilpotent adjacency matrices pose unique challenges towards developing DAG signal processing and machine learning tools. To address this limitation, we harness recent advances offering alternative definitions of causal shifts and convolutions for signals on DAGs. We develop a novel convolutional graph neural network that integrates learnable DAG filters to account for the partial ordering induced by the graph topology, thus providing valuable inductive bias to learn effective representations of DAG-supported data. We discuss the salient advantages and potential limitations of the proposed DAG convolutional network (DCN) and evaluate its performance on two learning tasks using synthetic data: network diffusion estimation and source identification. DCN compares favorably relative to several baselines, showcasing its promising potential.</p></details> |  |

With the potential for misuse escalating, the importance of discerning whether texts are human-authored or generated by LLMs has become paramount. Several preceding studies have ventured to address this challenge by employing binary classifiers to differentiate between human-written and LLM-generated text. Nevertheless, the reliability of these classifiers has been subject to question. Given that consequential decisions may hinge on the outcome of such classification, it is imperative that text source detection is of high caliber. In light of this, the present paper introduces DeepTextMark, a deep learning-driven text watermarking methodology devised for text source identification. By leveraging Word2Vec and Sentence Encoding for watermark insertion, alongside a transformer-based classifier for watermark detection, DeepTextMark epitomizes a blend of blindness, robustness, imperceptibility, and reliability. As elaborated within the paper, these attributes are crucial for universal text source detection, with a particular emphasis in this paper on text produced by LLMs. DeepTextMark offers a viable "add-on" solution to prevailing text generation frameworks, requiring no direct access or alterations to the underlying text generation mechanism. Experimental evaluations underscore the high imperceptibility, elevated detection accuracy, augmented robustness, reliability, and swift execution of DeepTextMark.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accpeted for publication by IEEE Access</p></details> |

Specifically, our approach utilizes a positional embedding module to distinguish nodes that are incomplete and employs a self-attention mechanism to focus on nodes with greater information transmission capacity. To mitigate the prediction bias caused by the significant disparity between the numbers of source and non-source nodes, we also introduce a class-balancing mechanism.

In this paper, we define input sentences that contain essential information in the generated summary as $\textit{source sentences}$ and study how abstractive summaries are made by analyzing the source sentences. To this end, we annotate source sentences for reference summaries and system summaries generated by PEGASUS on document-summary pairs sampled from the CNN/DailyMail and XSum datasets. We also formulate automatic source sentence detection and compare multiple methods to establish a strong baseline for the task. Experimental results show that the perplexity-based method performs well in highly abstractive settings, while similarity-based methods perform robustly in relatively extractive settings.

LLM-integrated applications serve as middleware to refine users' queries with domain-specific knowledge to better inform LLMs and enhance the responses. Despite numerous opportunities and benefits, LLM-integrated applications also introduce new attack surfaces. Understanding, minimizing, and eliminating these emerging attack surfaces is a new area of research. In this work, we consider a setup where the user and LLM interact via an LLM-integrated application in the middle. We focus on the communication rounds that begin with user's queries and end with LLM-integrated application returning responses to the queries, powered by LLMs at the service backend. For this query-response protocol, we identify potential vulnerabilities that can originate from the malicious application developer or from an outsider threat initiator that is able to control the database access, manipulate and poison data that are high-risk for the user. Successful exploits of the identified vulnerabilities result in the users receiving responses tailored to the intent of a threat initiator. We assess such threats against LLM-integrated applications empowered by OpenAI GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Our empirical results show that the threats can effectively bypass the restrictions and moderation policies of OpenAI, resulting in users receiving responses that contain bias, toxic content, privacy risk, and disinformation. To mitigate those threats, we identify and define four key properties, namely integrity, source identification, attack detectability, and utility preservation, that need to be satisfied by a safe LLM-integrated application. Based on these properties, we develop a lightweight, threat-agnostic defense that mitigates both insider and outsider threats.</p></details> |  |

In the algorithm, the mobile sensors perform source identification/localization to estimate the source location; meanwhile, they move to new locations to maximize the Fisher information about the source contained in the sensor measurements. In doing so, they improve the source location estimate and move closer to the source. Our algorithm is superior in convergence speed compared with traditional field climbing algorithms, is flexible in the measurement model and the choice of information metric, and is robust to measurement model errors. Moreover, we provide a fully distributed version of our algorithm, where each sensor decides its own actions and only shares information with its neighbors through a sparse communication network. We perform intensive simulation experiments to test our algorithms on large-scale systems and physical experiments on small ground vehicles with light sensors, demonstrating success in seeking a light source.</p></details> |  |

Although it is widely acknowledged that random and local gossip communications make source identification difficult, there exists no general quantification of the level of anonymity provided to the source. This paper presents a principled method based on $\varepsilon$-differential privacy to analyze the inherent source anonymity of gossiping for a large class of graphs. First, we quantify the fundamental limit of source anonymity any gossip protocol can guarantee in an arbitrary communication graph. In particular, our result indicates that when the graph has poor connectivity, no gossip protocol can guarantee any meaningful level of differential privacy. This prompted us to further analyze graphs with controlled connectivity. We prove on these graphs that a large class of gossip protocols, namely cobra walks, offers tangible differential privacy guarantees to the source. In doing so, we introduce an original proof technique based on the reduction of a gossip protocol to what we call a random walk with probabilistic die out. This proof technique is of independent interest to the gossip community and readily extends to other protocols inherited from the security community, such as the Dandelion protocol. Interestingly, our tight analysis precisely captures the trade-off between dissemination time of a gossip protocol and its source anonymity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of DISC2023 paper</p></details> |

Self-supervision tasks are often used to pre-train a neural network with a large amount of unlabeled data and extract generic features of the dataset. The learned model is likely to contain useful information which can be transferred to the downstream main task and improve performance compared to random parameter initialization. In this paper, we propose a new self-supervision task called source identification (SI), which is inspired by the classic blind source separation problem. Synthetic images are generated by fusing multiple source images and the network's task is to reconstruct the original images, given the fused images. A proper understanding of the image content is required to successfully solve the task. We validate our method on two medical image segmentation tasks: brain tumor segmentation and white matter hyperintensities segmentation. The results show that the proposed SI task outperforms traditional self-supervision tasks for dense predictions including inpainting, pixel shuffling, intensity shift, and super-resolution. Among variations of the SI task fusing images of different types, fusing images from different patients performs best.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Sequential Attention Source Identification Based on Feature Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15886v1)** | 2023-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Snapshot observation based source localization has been widely studied due to its accessibility and low cost. However, the interaction of users in existing methods does not be addressed in time-varying infection scenarios. So these methods have a decreased accuracy in heterogeneous interaction scenarios. To solve this critical issue, this paper proposes a sequence-to-sequence based localization framework called Temporal-sequence based Graph Attention Source Identification (TGASI) based on an inductive learning idea. More specifically, the encoder focuses on generating multiple features by estimating the influence probability between two users, and the decoder distinguishes the importance of prediction sources in different timestamps by a designed temporal attention mechanism. It's worth mentioning that the inductive learning idea ensures that TGASI can detect the sources in new scenarios without knowing other prior knowledge, which proves the scalability of TGASI. Comprehensive experiments with the SOTA methods demonstrate the higher detection performance and scalability in different scenarios of TGASI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weighted sparsity regularization for source identification for elliptic PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.11280v5)** | 2023-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This investigation is motivated by PDE-constrained optimization problems arising in connection with electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electroencephalography (EEG). Standard sparsity regularization does not necessarily produce adequate results for these applications because only boundary data/observations are available for the identification of the unknown source, which may be interior. We therefore study a weighted $\ell^1$-regularization technique for solving inverse problems when the forward operator has a significant null space. In particular, we prove that a sparse source, regardless of whether it is interior or located at the boundary, can be exactly recovered with this weighting procedure as the regularization parameter $\alpha$ tends to zero. Our analysis is supported by numerical experiments for cases with one and several local sources. The theory is developed in terms of Euclidean spaces, and our results can therefore be applied to many problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving High-Dimensional Inverse Problems with Auxiliary Uncertainty via Operator Learning with Limited Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11379v1)** | 2023-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex large-scale systems such as climate, important effects are caused by a combination of confounding processes that are not fully observable. The identification of sources from observations of system state is vital for attribution and prediction, which inform critical policy decisions. The difficulty of these types of inverse problems lies in the inability to isolate sources and the cost of simulating computational models. Surrogate models may enable the many-query algorithms required for source identification, but data challenges arise from high dimensionality of the state and source, limited ensembles of costly model simulations to train a surrogate model, and few and potentially noisy state observations for inversion due to measurement limitations. The influence of auxiliary processes adds an additional layer of uncertainty that further confounds source identification. We introduce a framework based on (1) calibrating deep neural network surrogates to the flow maps provided by an ensemble of simulations obtained by varying sources, and (2) using these surrogates in a Bayesian framework to identify sources from observations via optimization. Focusing on an atmospheric dispersion exemplar, we find that the expressive and computationally efficient nature of the deep neural network operator surrogates in appropriately reduced dimension allows for source identification with uncertainty quantification using limited data. Introducing a variable wind field as an auxiliary process, we find that a Bayesian approximation error approach is essential for reliable source inversion when uncertainty due to wind stresses the algorithm.</p></details> | 29 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Box constraints and weighted sparsity regularization for identifying sources in elliptic PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06069v2)** | 2023-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the possibility for using boundary data to identify sources in elliptic PDEs. Even though the associated forward operator has a large null space, it turns out that box constraints, combined with weighted sparsity regularization, can enable rather accurate recovery of sources with constant magnitude/strength. In addition, for sources with varying strength, the support of the inverse solution will be a subset of the support of the true source. We present both an analysis of the problem and a series of numerical experiments. Our work only addresses discretized problems. The reason for introducing the weighting procedure is that standard (unweighted) sparsity regularization fails to provide adequate results for the source identification task considered in this paper. This investigation is also motivated by applications, e.g., recovering mass distributions from measurements of gravitational fields and inverse scattering. We develop the methodology and the analysis in terms of Euclidean spaces, and our results can therefore be applied to many problems. For example, the results are equally applicable to models involving the screened Poisson equation as to models using the Helmholtz equation, with both large and small wave numbers.</p></details> |  |

Source camera identification of web photos aims to establish a reliable linkage from the captured images to their source cameras, and has a broad range of applications, such as image copyright protection, user authentication, investigated evidence verification, etc. This paper presents an innovative and practical source identification framework that employs neural-network enhanced sensor pattern noise to trace back web photos efficiently while ensuring security. Our proposed framework consists of three main stages: initial device fingerprint registration, fingerprint extraction and cryptographic connection establishment while taking photos, and connection verification between photos and source devices. By incorporating metric learning and frequency consistency into the deep network design, our proposed fingerprint extraction algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on modern smartphone photos for reliable source identification. Meanwhile, we also propose several optimization sub-modules to prevent fingerprint leakage and improve accuracy and efficiency. Finally for practical system design, two cryptographic schemes are introduced to reliably identify the correlation between registered fingerprint and verified photo fingerprint, i.e. fuzzy extractor and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP).

| **[Identification of Power System Oscillation Modes using Blind Source Separation based on Copula Statistic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03633v1)** | 2023-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamics of a power system with large penetration of renewable energy resources are becoming more nonlinear due to the intermittence of these resources and the switching of their power electronic devices. Therefore, it is crucial to accurately identify the dynamical modes of oscillation of such a power system when it is subject to disturbances to initiate appropriate preventive or corrective control actions. In this paper, we propose a high-order blind source identification (HOBI) algorithm based on the copula statistic to address these non-linear dynamics in modal analysis. The method combined with Hilbert transform (HOBI-HT) and iteration procedure (HOBMI) can identify all the modes as well as the model order from the observation signals obtained from the number of channels as low as one. We access the performance of the proposed method on numerical simulation signals and recorded data from a simulation of time domain analysis on the classical 11-Bus 4-Machine test system. Our simulation results outperform the state-of-the-art method in accuracy and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the IEEE PES General Meeting 2023</p></details> |

| **[End-to-end Recording Device Identification Based on Deep Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02084v1)** | 2022-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning techniques have achieved specific results in recording device source identification. The recording device source features include spatial information and certain temporal information. However, most recording device source identification methods based on deep learning only use spatial representation learning from recording device source features, which cannot make full use of recording device source information. Therefore, in this paper, to fully explore the spatial information and temporal information of recording device source, we propose a new method for recording device source identification based on the fusion of spatial feature information and temporal feature information by using an end-to-end framework. From a feature perspective, we designed two kinds of networks to extract recording device source spatial and temporal information. Afterward, we use the attention mechanism to adaptively assign the weight of spatial information and temporal information to obtain fusion features. From a model perspective, our model uses an end-to-end framework to learn the deep representation from spatial feature and temporal feature and train using deep and shallow loss to joint optimize our network. This method is compared with our previous work and baseline system. The results show that the proposed method is better than our previous work and baseline system under general conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, recording device identification</p></details> |
| **[Deep Learning Object Detection Approaches to Signal Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16173v2)** | 2022-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally source identification is solved using threshold based energy detection algorithms. These algorithms frequently sum up the activity in regions, and consider regions above a specific activity threshold to be sources. While these algorithms work for the majority of cases, they often fail to detect signals that occupy small frequency bands, fail to distinguish sources with overlapping frequency bands, and cannot detect any signals under a specified signal to noise ratio. Through the conversion of raw signal data to spectrogram, source identification can be framed as an object detection problem. By leveraging modern advancements in deep learning based object detection, we propose a system that manages to alleviate the failure cases encountered when using traditional source identification algorithms. Our contributions include framing source identification as an object detection problem, the publication of a spectrogram object detection dataset, and evaluation of the RetinaNet and YOLOv5 object detection models trained on the dataset. Our final models achieve Mean Average Precisions of up to 0.906. With such a high Mean Average Precision, these models are sufficiently robust for use in real world applications.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the latest technology potentially enables new digital ways to lie. In response, the need for a diverse and reliable method toolbox arises to identify artificial images and other content. Previous work primarily relies on pixel-space CNNs or the Fourier transform. To the best of our knowledge, synthesized fake image analysis and detection methods based on a multi-scale wavelet representation, localized in both space and frequency, have been absent thus far. The wavelet transform conserves spatial information to a degree, which allows us to present a new analysis. Comparing the wavelet coefficients of real and fake images allows interpretation. Significant differences are identified. Additionally, this paper proposes to learn a model for the detection of synthetic images based on the wavelet-packet representation of natural and GAN-generated images. Our lightweight forensic classifiers exhibit competitive or improved performance at comparatively small network sizes, as we demonstrate on the FFHQ, CelebA and LSUN source identification problems.

| **[GPU-accelerated SIFT-aided source identification of stabilized videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14507v1)** | 2022-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video stabilization is an in-camera processing commonly applied by modern acquisition devices. While significantly improving the visual quality of the resulting videos, it has been shown that such operation typically hinders the forensic analysis of video signals. In fact, the correct identification of the acquisition source usually based on Photo Response non-Uniformity (PRNU) is subject to the estimation of the transformation applied to each frame in the stabilization phase. A number of techniques have been proposed for dealing with this problem, which however typically suffer from a high computational burden due to the grid search in the space of inversion parameters. Our work attempts to alleviate these shortcomings by exploiting the parallelization capabilities of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), typically used for deep learning applications, in the framework of stabilised frames inversion. Moreover, we propose to exploit SIFT features {to estimate the camera momentum and} %to identify less stabilized temporal segments, thus enabling a more accurate identification analysis, and to efficiently initialize the frame-wise parameter search of consecutive frames. Experiments on a consolidated benchmark dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in reducing the required computational time and improving the source identification accuracy. {The code is available at \url{https://github.com/AMontiB/GPU-PRNU-SIFT}}.</p></details> |  |

In addition to the problem of over-exploitation, in total disagreement with the concept of sustainable development, another not negligible issue concerns the groundwater contamination. Mainly, this aspect is due to intensive agricultural activities or industrialized areas. In literature, several papers have dealt with transport problem, especially for inverse problems in which the release history or the source location are identified. The innovative aim of the paper is to develop a data-driven model that is able to analyze multiple scenarios, even strongly non-linear, in order to solve forward and inverse transport problems, preserving the reliability of the results and reducing the uncertainty. Furthermore, this tool has the characteristic of providing extremely fast responses, essential to identify remediation strategies immediately. The advantages produced by the model were compared with literature studies. In this regard, a feedforward artificial neural network, which has been trained to handle different cases, represents the data-driven model. Firstly, to identify the concentration of the pollutant at specific observation points in the study area (forward problem); secondly, to deal with inverse problems identifying the release history at known source location; then, in case of one contaminant source, identifying the release history and, at the same time, the location of the source in a specific sub-domain of the investigated area. At last, the observation error is investigated and estimated. The results are satisfactorily achieved, highlighting the capability of the ANN to deal with multiple scenarios by approximating nonlinear functions without the physical point of view that describes the phenomenon, providing reliable results, with very low computational burden and uncertainty.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Journal of Hydrology</p></details> |

In the frequency domain aeroacoustic sound propagation can be modelled as a random source problem for a convected Helmholtz equation. This article is concerned with the inverse random source problem to recover the support of an uncorrelated aeroacoustic source from correlations of observed pressure signals. We show that a variant of the factorization method from inverse scattering theory can be used for this purpose. We also discuss a surprising relation between the factorization method and a commonly used beamforming algorithm from experimental aeroacoustics, which is known as Capon's method or as the minimum variance method. Numerical examples illustrate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

| **[On the Exploitation of Deepfake Model Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04513v1)** | 2022-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), with special focus to the Deepfake phenomenon there is no a clear understanding neither in terms of explainability nor of recognition of the involved models. In particular, the recognition of a specific GAN model that generated the deepfake image compared to many other possible models created by the same generative architecture (e.g. StyleGAN) is a task not yet completely addressed in the state-of-the-art. In this work, a robust processing pipeline to evaluate the possibility to point-out analytic fingerprints for Deepfake model recognition is presented. After exploiting the latent space of 50 slightly different models through an in-depth analysis on the generated images, a proper encoder was trained to discriminate among these models obtaining a classification accuracy of over 96%. Once demonstrated the possibility to discriminate extremely similar images, a dedicated metric exploiting the insights discovered in the latent space was introduced. By achieving a final accuracy of more than 94% for the Model Recognition task on images generated by models not employed in the training phase, this study takes an important step in countering the Deepfake phenomenon introducing a sort of signature in some sense similar to those employed in the multimedia forensics field (e.g. for camera source identification task, image ballistics task, etc).</p></details> |  |
| **[Online non-convex learning for river pollution source identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11065v2)** | 2022-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, novel gradient-based online learning algorithms are developed to investigate an important environmental application: real-time river pollution source identification, which aims at estimating the released mass, location, and time of a river pollution source based on downstream sensor data monitoring the pollution concentration. The pollution is assumed to be instantaneously released once. The problem can be formulated as a non-convex loss minimization problem in statistical learning, and our online algorithms have vectorized and adaptive step sizes to ensure high estimation accuracy in three dimensions which have different magnitudes. In order to keep the algorithm from stucking to the saddle points of non-convex loss, the escaping from saddle points module and multi-start setting are derived to further improve the estimation accuracy by searching for the global minimizer of the loss functions. This can be shown theoretically and experimentally as the $O(N)$ local regret of the algorithms and the high probability cumulative regret bound $O(N)$ under a particular error bound condition in loss functions. A real-life river pollution source identification example shows the superior performance of our algorithms compared to existing methods in terms of estimation accuracy. Managerial insights for the decision maker to use the algorithms are also provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[The power of adaptivity in source identification with time queries on the path](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.07336v4)** | 2021-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of identifying the source of a stochastic diffusion process spreading on a graph based on the arrival times of the diffusion at a few queried nodes. In a graph $G=(V,E)$, an unknown source node $v^* \in V$ is drawn uniformly at random, and unknown edge weights $w(e)$ for $e\in E$, representing the propagation delays along the edges, are drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution of mean $1$ and variance $\sigma^2$. An algorithm then attempts to identify $v^*$ by querying nodes $q \in V$ and being told the length of the shortest path between $q$ and $v^*$ in graph $G$ weighted by $w$. We consider two settings: non-adaptive, in which all query nodes must be decided in advance, and adaptive, in which each query can depend on the results of the previous ones. Both settings are motivated by an application of the problem to epidemic processes (where the source is called patient zero), which we discuss in detail. We characterize the query complexity when $G$ is an $n$-node path. In the non-adaptive setting, $\Theta(n\sigma^2)$ queries are needed for $\sigma^2 \leq 1$, and $\Theta(n)$ for $\sigma^2 \geq 1$. In the adaptive setting, somewhat surprisingly, only $\Theta(\log\log_{1/\sigma}n)$ are needed when $\sigma^2 \leq 1/2$, and $\Theta(\log \log n)+O_\sigma(1)$ when $\sigma^2 \geq 1/2$. This is the first mathematical study of source identification with time queries in a non-deterministic diffusion process.</p></details> |  |

In this work we are concerned with the determination of a time-dependent source in a transport equation from noisy data measured at a fixed position. By means of Fourier techniques can be shown that the problem is ill-posed in the sense that the solution exists but it does not vary continuously with the data. A number of different techniques were developed by other authors to approximate the solution. In this work, we consider a family of parametric regularization operators to deal with the ill-posedness of the problem. We proposed a manner to select the regularization parameter as a function of noise level in data in order to obtain a regularized solution that approximate the unknown source. We find a H\"older type bound for the error of the approximated source when the unknown function is considered to be bounded in a given norm. Numerical examples illustrate the convergence and stability of the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages, 2 Figures, 2 Tables</p></details> |

We further summarized representative diffusion modeling in special scenarios and significant downstream tasks based on these elementary models.

Though the core dynamics follows some principles of physics, real-world physical processes are often driven by unknown external sources. In such cases, developing a purely analytical model becomes very difficult and data-driven modeling can be of assistance. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework combining physics-based numerical models with deep learning for source identification and forecasting of spatio-temporal dynamical systems with unobservable time-varying external sources. We formulate our model PhICNet as a convolutional recurrent neural network (RNN) which is end-to-end trainable for spatio-temporal evolution prediction of dynamical systems and learns the source behavior as an internal state of the RNN. Experimental results show that the proposed model can forecast the dynamics for a relatively long time and identify the sources as well.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 16 figures.

| **[Multi-clue reconstruction of sharing chains for social media images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02515v1)** | 2021-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The amount of multimedia content shared everyday, combined with the level of realism reached by recent fake-generating technologies, threatens to impair the trustworthiness of online information sources. The process of uploading and sharing data tends to hinder standard media forensic analyses, since multiple re-sharing steps progressively hide the traces of past manipulations. At the same time though, new traces are introduced by the platforms themselves, enabling the reconstruction of the sharing history of digital objects, with possible applications in information flow monitoring and source identification. In this work, we propose a supervised framework for the reconstruction of image sharing chains on social media platforms. The system is structured as a cascade of backtracking blocks, each of them tracing back one step of the sharing chain at a time. Blocks are designed as ensembles of classifiers trained to analyse the input image independently from one another by leveraging different feature representations that describe both content and container of the media object. Individual decisions are then properly combined by a late fusion strategy. Results highlight the advantages of employing multiple clues, which allow accurately tracing back up to three steps along the sharing chain.</p></details> |  |

| **[Diffusion Source Identification on Networks with Statistical Confidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04800v2)** | 2021-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion source identification on networks is a problem of fundamental importance in a broad class of applications, including rumor controlling and virus identification. Though this problem has received significant recent attention, most studies have focused only on very restrictive settings and lack theoretical guarantees for more realistic networks. We introduce a statistical framework for the study of diffusion source identification and develop a confidence set inference approach inspired by hypothesis testing. Our method efficiently produces a small subset of nodes, which provably covers the source node with any pre-specified confidence level without restrictive assumptions on network structures. Moreover, we propose multiple Monte Carlo strategies for the inference procedure based on network topology and the probabilistic properties that significantly improve the scalability. To our knowledge, this is the first diffusion source identification method with a practically useful theoretical guarantee on general networks. We demonstrate our approach via extensive synthetic experiments on well-known random network models and a mobility network between cities concerning the COVID-19 spreading.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification of high-energy astrophysical point sources via hierarchical Bayesian nonparametric clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11492v2)** | 2021-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The light we receive from distant astrophysical objects carries information about their origins and the physical mechanisms that power them. The study of these signals, however, is complicated by the fact that observations are often a mixture of the light emitted by multiple localized sources situated in a spatially-varying background. A general algorithm to achieve robust and accurate source identification in this case remains an open question in astrophysics. This paper focuses on high-energy light (such as X-rays and gamma-rays), for which observatories can detect individual photons (quanta of light), measuring their incoming direction, arrival time, and energy. Our proposed Bayesian methodology uses both the spatial and energy information to identify point sources, that is, separate them from the spatially-varying background, to estimate their number, and to compute the posterior probabilities that each photon originated from each identified source. This is accomplished via a Dirichlet process mixture while the background is simultaneously reconstructed via a flexible Bayesian nonparametric model based on B-splines. Our proposed method is validated with a suite of simulation studies and illustrated with an application to a complex region of the sky observed by the \emph{Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope.</p></details> |  |

Diffusive capture problems are computationally challenging due to the complex geometry and the applied boundary conditions together with intrinsically long transients that occur before a particle is captured. This paper reports on a particle-based Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that provides rapid accurate simulation of arrival statistics for (i) a half-space bounded by a surface with a finite collection of absorbing traps and (ii) the domain exterior to a convex cell again with absorbing traps. We validate our method by replicating classical results and in addition, newly developed boundary homogenization theories and matched asymptotic expansions on capture rates. In the case of non-spherical domains, we describe a new shielding effect in which geometry can play a role in sharpening cellular estimates on the directionality of diffusive sources.</p></details> | 32 pages, 10 figures |

Conventional manual cataloging methodologies are anticipated to be insufficient to exploit the capabilities of new radio surveys. Radio interferometric images of diffuse sources present a challenge for image segmentation tasks due to noise, artifacts, and embedded radio sources. In response to these challenges, we introduce Radio U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture. Radio U-Net is designed to detect faint and extended sources in radio surveys, such as radio halos, relics, and cosmic web filaments. Radio U-Net was trained on synthetic radio observations built upon cosmological simulations and then tested on a sample of galaxy clusters, where the detection of cluster diffuse radio sources relied on customized data reduction and visual inspection of LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data. The 83% of clusters exhibiting diffuse radio emission were accurately identified, and the segmentation successfully recovered the morphology of the sources even in low-quality images. In a test sample comprising 246 galaxy clusters, we achieved a 73% accuracy rate in distinguishing between clusters with and without diffuse radio emission. Our results establish the applicability of Radio U-Net to extensive radio survey datasets, probing its efficiency on cutting-edge high-performance computing systems. This approach represents an advancement in optimizing the exploitation of forthcoming large radio surveys for scientific exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MNRAS, 16 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Source Localization for Cross Network Information Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14668v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source localization aims to locate information diffusion sources only given the diffusion observation, which has attracted extensive attention in the past few years. Existing methods are mostly tailored for single networks and may not be generalized to handle more complex networks like cross-networks. Cross-network is defined as two interconnected networks, where one network's functionality depends on the other. Source localization on cross-networks entails locating diffusion sources on the source network by only giving the diffused observation in the target network. The task is challenging due to challenges including: 1) diffusion sources distribution modeling; 2) jointly considering both static and dynamic node features; and 3) heterogeneous diffusion patterns learning. In this work, we propose a novel method, namely CNSL, to handle the three primary challenges. Specifically, we propose to learn the distribution of diffusion sources through Bayesian inference and leverage disentangled encoders to separately learn static and dynamic node features. The learning objective is coupled with the cross-network information propagation estimation model to make the inference of diffusion sources considering the overall diffusion process. Additionally, we also provide two novel cross-network datasets collected by ourselves. Extensive experiments are conducted on both datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{CNSL} in handling the source localization on cross-networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data are available at: https://github.com/tanmoysr/CNSL/</p></details> |

Recent advances of cross-modal foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have made this problem feasible. Those approaches commonly leverage CLIP to align the holistic semantics of stylized mesh with the given text prompt. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to enable more controllable stylization of fine-grained details in 3D meshes solely based on such semantic-level cross-modal supervision. In this work, we propose a new 3DStyle-Diffusion model that triggers fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes with additional controllable appearance and geometric guidance from 2D Diffusion models. Technically, 3DStyle-Diffusion first parameterizes the texture of 3D mesh into reflectance properties and scene lighting using implicit MLP networks. Meanwhile, an accurate depth map of each sampled view is achieved conditioned on 3D mesh. Then, 3DStyle-Diffusion leverages a pre-trained controllable 2D Diffusion model to guide the learning of rendered images, encouraging the synthesized image of each view semantically aligned with text prompt and geometrically consistent with depth map. This way elegantly integrates both image rendering via implicit MLP networks and diffusion process of image synthesis in an end-to-end fashion, enabling a high-quality fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes. We also build a new dataset derived from Objaverse and the evaluation protocol for this task. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we validate the capability of our 3DStyle-Diffusion.

Characterizing the virality and growth of cascades](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01027v3)** | 2022-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying the virality of cascades is an important question across disciplines such as the transmission of disease, the spread of information and the diffusion of innovations. An appropriate virality metric should be able to disambiguate between a shallow, broadcast-like diffusion process and a deep, multi-generational branching process. Although several valuable works have been dedicated to this field, most of them fail to take the position of the diffusion source into consideration, which makes them fall into the trap of graph isomorphism and would result in imprecise estimation of cascade virality inevitably under certain circumstances. In this paper, we propose a root-aware approach to quantifying the virality of cascades with proper consideration of the root node in a diffusion tree. With applications on synthetic and empirical cascades, we show the properties and potential utility of the proposed virality measure. Based on preferential attachment mechanisms, we further introduce a model to mimic the growth of cascades. The proposed model enables the interpolation between broadcast and viral spreading during the growth of cascades. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in characterizing the virality of growing cascades. Our work contributes to the understanding of cascade virality and growth, and could offer practical implications in a range of policy domains including viral marketing, infectious disease and information diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Source Localization of Graph Diffusion via Variational Autoencoders for Graph Inverse Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12327v1)** | 2022-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph diffusion problems such as the propagation of rumors, computer viruses, or smart grid failures are ubiquitous and societal. Hence it is usually crucial to identify diffusion sources according to the current graph diffusion observations. Despite its tremendous necessity and significance in practice, source localization, as the inverse problem of graph diffusion, is extremely challenging as it is ill-posed: different sources may lead to the same graph diffusion patterns. Different from most traditional source localization methods, this paper focuses on a probabilistic manner to account for the uncertainty of different candidate sources. Such endeavors require overcoming challenges including 1) the uncertainty in graph diffusion source localization is hard to be quantified; 2) the complex patterns of the graph diffusion sources are difficult to be probabilistically characterized; 3) the generalization under any underlying diffusion patterns is hard to be imposed. To solve the above challenges, this paper presents a generic framework: Source Localization Variational AutoEncoder (SL-VAE) for locating the diffusion sources under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Particularly, we propose a probabilistic model that leverages the forward diffusion estimation model along with deep generative models to approximate the diffusion source distribution for quantifying the uncertainty. SL-VAE further utilizes prior knowledge of the source-observation pairs to characterize the complex patterns of diffusion sources by a learned generative prior. Lastly, a unified objective that integrates the forward diffusion estimation model is derived to enforce the model to generalize under arbitrary diffusion patterns. Extensive experiments are conducted on 7 real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of SL-VAE in reconstructing the diffusion sources by excelling other methods on average 20% in AUC score.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, accepted by SIGKDD 2022</p></details> |

In particular, we formulate a candidate set which contains the diffusion source for sure, and propose the method, Percolation-based Evolutionary Framework (PrEF), to minimize such set. Hence one could further conduct more intensive investigation on only a few nodes to target the source. To achieve that, we first demonstrate that there are some similarities between the DSL problem and the network immunization problem. We find that the minimization of the candidate set is equivalent to the minimization of the order parameter if we view the observer set as the removal node set. Hence, PrEF is developed based on the network percolation and evolutionary algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated on both model and empirical networks in regard to varied circumstances. Our results show that the developed approach could achieve a much smaller candidate set compared to the state of the art in almost all cases. Meanwhile, our approach is also more stable, i.e., it has similar performance irrespective of varied infection probabilities, diffusion models, and outbreak ranges. More importantly, our approach might provide a new framework to tackle the DSL problem in extreme large networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Social Diffusion Sources Can Escape Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.10539v2)** | 2021-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Influencing (and being influenced by) others through social networks is fundamental to all human societies. Whether this happens through the diffusion of rumors, opinions, or viruses, identifying the diffusion source (i.e., the person that initiated it) is a problem that has attracted much research interest. Nevertheless, existing literature has ignored the possibility that the source might strategically modify the network structure (by rewiring links or introducing fake nodes) to escape detection. Here, without restricting our analysis to any particular diffusion scenario, we close this gap by evaluating two mechanisms that hide the source-one stemming from the source's actions, the other from the network structure itself. This reveals that sources can easily escape detection, and that removing links is far more effective than introducing fake nodes. Thus, efforts should focus on exposing concealed ties rather than planted entities; such exposure would drastically improve our chances of detecting the diffusion source.</p></details> | <details><summary>100 p...</summary><p>100 pages, 80 figures</p></details> |

In our application, denoising is intended to address both the reduction of random instrumental noise and the minimisation of additional spurious artefacts like the sidelobes, resulting from the aperture synthesis technique. The effectiveness and the accuracy of the method are analysed for different kinds of corrupted input images, together with its computational performance. Specific attention has been devoted to create realistic mock observations for the training, exploiting the outcomes of cosmological numerical simulations, to generate images corresponding to LOFAR HBA 8 hours observations at 150 MHz. Our autoencoder can effectively denoise complex images identifying and extracting faint objects at the limits of the instrumental sensitivity. The method can efficiently scale on large datasets, exploiting high performance computing solutions, in a fully automated way (i.e. no human supervision is required after training). It can accurately perform image segmentation, identifying low brightness outskirts of diffused sources, proving to be a viable solution for detecting challenging extended objects hidden in noisy radio observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, Accepted for publication by MNRAS</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Source Identification on Networks with Statistical Confidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04800v2)** | 2021-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion source identification on networks is a problem of fundamental importance in a broad class of applications, including rumor controlling and virus identification. Though this problem has received significant recent attention, most studies have focused only on very restrictive settings and lack theoretical guarantees for more realistic networks. We introduce a statistical framework for the study of diffusion source identification and develop a confidence set inference approach inspired by hypothesis testing. Our method efficiently produces a small subset of nodes, which provably covers the source node with any pre-specified confidence level without restrictive assumptions on network structures. Moreover, we propose multiple Monte Carlo strategies for the inference procedure based on network topology and the probabilistic properties that significantly improve the scalability. To our knowledge, this is the first diffusion source identification method with a practically useful theoretical guarantee on general networks. We demonstrate our approach via extensive synthetic experiments on well-known random network models and a mobility network between cities concerning the COVID-19 spreading.</p></details> |  |

We consider the case when respondents may not always be truthful and some cost is taken for each query. Our goal is to quantify the necessary and sufficient budgets to achieve the detection probability $1-\delta$ for any given $0<\delta<1.$ To this end, we study two types of algorithms: adaptive and non-adaptive ones, each of which corresponds to whether we adaptively select the next respondents based on the answers of the previous respondents or not.

Due to the abundance of fBm processes in nature, significant efforts have been devoted to the identification and characterization of fBm sources in various phenomena. In practice, the identification of the fBm sources often relies on solving a complex and ill-posed inverse problem based on limited observed data. In the general case, the detected signals are formed by an unknown number of release sources, located at different locations and with different strengths, that act simultaneously. This means that the observed data is composed of mixtures of releases from an unknown number of sources, which makes the traditional inverse modeling approaches unreliable. Here, we report an unsupervised learning method, based on Nonnegative Matrix Factorization, that enables the identification of the unknown number of release sources as well the anomalous diffusion characteristics based on limited observed data and the general form of the corresponding fBm Green's function. We show that our method performs accurately for different types of sources and configurations with a predetermined number of sources with specific characteristics and introduced noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in physical review research</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Localization of Diffusion Sources in Complex Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.04915v1)** | 2017-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating sources of diffusion and spreading from minimum data is a significant problem in network science with great applied values to the society. However, a general theoretical framework dealing with optimal source localization is lacking. Combining the controllability theory for complex networks and compressive sensing, we develop a framework with high efficiency and robustness for optimal source localization in arbitrary weighted networks with arbitrary distribution of sources. We offer a minimum output analysis to quantify the source locatability through a minimal number of messenger nodes that produce sufficient measurement for fully locating the sources. When the minimum messenger nodes are discerned, the problem of optimal source localization becomes one of sparse signal reconstruction, which can be solved using compressive sensing. Application of our framework to model and empirical networks demonstrates that sources in homogeneous and denser networks are more readily to be located. A surprising finding is that, for a connected undirected network with random link weights and weak noise, a single messenger node is sufficient for locating any number of sources. The framework deepens our understanding of the network source localization problem and offers efficient tools with broad applications.</p></details> | 6 figures |

We propose a new source localization algorithm, named Optimal-Jordan-Cover (OJC). The algorithm first extracts a subgraph using a candidate selection algorithm that selects source candidates based on the number of observed infected nodes in their neighborhoods. Then, in the extracted subgraph, OJC finds a set of nodes that "cover" all observed infected nodes with the minimum radius. The set of nodes is called the Jordan cover, and is regarded as the set of diffusion sources. Considering the heterogeneous susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) diffusion in the Erdos-Renyi (ER) random graph, we prove that OJC can locate all sources with probability one asymptotically with partial observations. OJC is a polynomial-time algorithm in terms of network size. However, the computational complexity increases exponentially in $m,$ the number of sources. We further propose a low-complexity heuristic based on the K-Means for approximating the Jordan cover, named Approximate-Jordan-Cover (AJC). Simulations on random graphs and real networks demonstrate that both AJC and OJC significantly outperform other heuristic algorithms.</p></details> | 16 figures |

The collective signal strength at the receiver (i.e., the expected number of observed molecules inside the receiver), resulting from a large number of transmitters at random distances (e.g., due to mobility), can have a major impact on the reliability and efficiency of the molecular communication system. Modeling the collective signal from multiple diffusion sources can be computationally and analytically challenging. In this paper, we present the first tractable analytical model for the collective signal strength due to randomly-placed transmitters, whose positions are modelled as a homogeneous Poisson point process in three-dimensional (3D) space. By applying stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions for the expected number of observed molecules at a fully absorbing receiver and a passive receiver. Our results reveal that the collective signal strength at both types of receivers increases proportionally with increasing transmitter density. The proposed framework dramatically simplifies the analysis of large-scale molecular systems in both communication and biological applications.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Existing approaches in rumor source detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study, we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion. Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach, showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI25 |

In this situation, it can become increasingly difficult to discern what information is false or true. If false information proliferates significantly, it can lead to undesirable outcomes. Hence, when we receive some information, we can pose the following two questions: $(i)$ Is the information true? $(ii)$ If not, who initially spread that information? % The first problem is the rumor detection issue, while the second is the rumor source detection problem. A rumor-detection problem involves identifying and mitigating false or misleading information spread via various communication channels, particularly online platforms and social media. Rumors can range from harmless ones to deliberately misleading content aimed at deceiving or manipulating audiences. Detecting misinformation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of information ecosystems and preventing harmful effects such as the spread of false beliefs, polarization, and even societal harm. Therefore, it is very important to quickly distinguish such misinformation while simultaneously finding its source to block it from spreading on the network. However, most of the existing surveys have analyzed these two issues separately. In this work, we first survey the existing research on the rumor-detection and rumor source detection problems with joint detection approaches, simultaneously. % This survey deals with these two issues together so that their relationship can be observed and it provides how the two problems are similar and different. The limitations arising from the rumor detection, rumor source detection, and their combination problems are also explained, and some challenges to be addressed in future works are presented.</p></details> |  |

Past research has indicated that content-based (i.e., using solely source posts as input) rumor detection models tend to perform less effectively on unseen rumors. At the same time, the potential of context-based models remains largely untapped. The main contribution of this paper is in the in-depth evaluation of the performance gap between content and context-based models specifically on detecting new, unseen rumors. Our empirical findings demonstrate that context-based models are still overly dependent on the information derived from the rumors' source post and tend to overlook the significant role that contextual information can play. We also study the effect of data split strategies on classifier performance. Based on our experimental results, the paper also offers practical suggestions on how to minimize the effects of temporal concept drift in static datasets during the training of rumor detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

In this model, a small subset of nodes from a network are the source of a rumor. In discrete time steps, each informed node "infects" each of its uninformed neighbors with probability $p$. While many facets of this process are studied in the literature, less is known about the inference problem: given a number of infected nodes in a network, can we learn the source of the rumor? In the context of epidemiology this problem is often referred to as patient zero problem. It belongs to a broader class of problems where the goal is to infer parameters of the underlying spreading model, see, e.g., Lokhov [NeurIPS'16] or Mastakouri et al. [NeurIPS'20]. In this work we present a maximum likelihood estimator for the rumor's source, given a snapshot of the process in terms of a set of active nodes $X$ after $t$ steps. Our results show that, for cycle-free graphs, the likelihood estimator undergoes a non-trivial phase transition as a function $t$. We provide a rigorous analysis for two prominent classes of acyclic network, namely $d$-regular trees and Galton-Watson trees, and verify empirically that our heuristics work well in various general networks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Rumor Source Detection under Querying with Untruthful Answers](http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05496v5)** | 2020-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social networks are the major routes for most individuals to exchange their opinions about new products, social trends and political issues via their interactions. It is often of significant importance to figure out who initially diffuses the information, ie, finding a rumor source or a trend setter. It is known that such a task is highly challenging and the source detection probability cannot be beyond 31 percent for regular trees, if we just estimate the source from a given diffusion snapshot. In practice, finding the source often entails the process of querying that asks "Are you the rumor source?" or "Who tells you the rumor?" that would increase the chance of detecting the source. In this paper, we consider two kinds of querying: (a) simple batch querying and (b) interactive querying with direction under the assumption that queries can be untruthful with some probability. We propose estimation algorithms for those queries, and quantify their detection performance and the amount of extra budget due to untruthfulness, analytically showing that querying significantly improves the detection performance. We perform extensive simulations to validate our theoretical findings over synthetic and real-world social network topologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rumor source detection with multiple observations under adaptive diffusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11211v1)** | 2020-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work, motivated by anonymous messaging platforms, has introduced adaptive diffusion protocols which can obfuscate the source of a rumor: a "snapshot adversary" with access to the subgraph of "infected" nodes can do no better than randomly guessing the entity of the source node. What happens if the adversary has access to multiple independent snapshots? We study this question when the underlying graph is the infinite $d$-regular tree. We show that (1) a weak form of source obfuscation is still possible in the case of two independent snapshots, but (2) already with three observations there is a simple algorithm that finds the rumor source with constant probability, regardless of the adaptive diffusion protocol. We also characterize the tradeoff between local spreading and source obfuscation for adaptive diffusion protocols (under a single snapshot). These results raise questions about the robustness of anonymity guarantees when spreading information in social networks.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |
| **[RP-DNN: A Tweet level propagation context based deep neural networks for early rumor detection in Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2002.12683v2)** | 2020-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early rumor detection (ERD) on social media platform is very challenging when limited, incomplete and noisy information is available. Most of the existing methods have largely worked on event-level detection that requires the collection of posts relevant to a specific event and relied only on user-generated content. They are not appropriate to detect rumor sources in the very early stages, before an event unfolds and becomes widespread. In this paper, we address the task of ERD at the message level. We present a novel hybrid neural network architecture, which combines a task-specific character-based bidirectional language model and stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to represent textual contents and social-temporal contexts of input source tweets, for modelling propagation patterns of rumors in the early stages of their development. We apply multi-layered attention models to jointly learn attentive context embeddings over multiple context inputs. Our experiments employ a stringent leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) evaluation setup on seven publicly available real-life rumor event data sets. Our models achieve state-of-the-art(SoA) performance for detecting unseen rumors on large augmented data which covers more than 12 events and 2,967 rumors. An ablation study is conducted to understand the relative contribution of each component of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted for publication at The LREC 2020 Proceedings.

| **[Neural Language Model Based Training Data Augmentation for Weakly Supervised Early Rumor Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.07033v1)** | 2019-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity and class imbalance of training data are known issues in current rumor detection tasks. We propose a straight-forward and general-purpose data augmentation technique which is beneficial to early rumor detection relying on event propagation patterns. The key idea is to exploit massive unlabeled event data sets on social media to augment limited labeled rumor source tweets. This work is based on rumor spreading patterns revealed by recent rumor studies and semantic relatedness between labeled and unlabeled data. A state-of-the-art neural language model (NLM) and large credibility-focused Twitter corpora are employed to learn context-sensitive representations of rumor tweets. Six different real-world events based on three publicly available rumor datasets are employed in our experiments to provide a comparative evaluation of the effectiveness of the method. The results show that our method can expand the size of an existing rumor data set nearly by 200% and corresponding social context (i.e., conversational threads) by 100% with reasonable quality. Preliminary experiments with a state-of-the-art deep learning-based rumor detection model show that augmented data can alleviate over-fitting and class imbalance caused by limited train data and can help to train complex neural networks (NNs). With augmented data, the performance of rumor detection can be improved by 12.1% in terms of F-score. Our experiments also indicate that augmented training data can help to generalize rumor detection models on unseen rumors.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[On the Distance Between the Rumor Source and Its Optimal Estimate in a Regular Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03039v2)** | 2019-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the rumor source identification problem, where the goal is to find the origin node of a rumor in a network among a given set of nodes with the rumor. In this paper, we focus on a network represented by a regular tree which does not have any cycle and in which all nodes have the same number of edges connected to a node. For this network, we clarify that, with quite high probability, the origin node is within the distance 3 from the node selected by the optimal estimator, where the distance is the number of edges of the unique path connecting two nodes. This is clarified by the probability distribution of the distance between the origin and the selected node.</p></details> | <details><summary>fixed...</summary><p>fixed typos and proofs, 16 pages, 2 figures, a short version of this paper has been submitted to the 2019 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT 2019)</p></details> |

Unlike existing approaches, our proposed algorithm identifies as sources those nodes, which when set as sources, result in the smallest dominant eigenvalue of the corresponding reduced nonbacktracking matrix deduced from message passing equations. We also propose a reduced-complexity algorithm derived from the previous algorithm through a perturbation approximation. Numerical experiments on synthesized and real-world networks suggest that these proposed algorithms generally have higher accuracy compared with representative existing algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at GlobalSIP 2018</p></details> |
| **[Hiding the Rumor Source](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02849v2)** | 2016-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anonymous social media platforms like Secret, Yik Yak, and Whisper have emerged as important tools for sharing ideas without the fear of judgment. Such anonymous platforms are also important in nations under authoritarian rule, where freedom of expression and the personal safety of message authors may depend on anonymity. Whether for fear of judgment or retribution, it is sometimes crucial to hide the identities of users who post sensitive messages. In this paper, we consider a global adversary who wishes to identify the author of a message; it observes either a snapshot of the spread of a message at a certain time, sampled timestamp metadata, or both. Recent advances in rumor source detection show that existing messaging protocols are vulnerable against such an adversary. We introduce a novel messaging protocol, which we call adaptive diffusion, and show that under the snapshot adversarial model, adaptive diffusion spreads content fast and achieves perfect obfuscation of the source when the underlying contact network is an infinite regular tree. That is, all users with the message are nearly equally likely to have been the origin of the message. When the contact network is an irregular tree, we characterize the probability of maximum likelihood detection by proving a concentration result over Galton-Watson trees. Experiments on a sampled Facebook network demonstrate that adaptive diffusion effectively hides the location of the source even when the graph is finite, irregular and has cycles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identification of Source of Rumors in Social Networks with Incomplete Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00557v1)** | 2015-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rumor source identification in large social networks has received significant attention lately. Most recent works deal with the scale of the problem by observing a subset of the nodes in the network, called sensors, to estimate the source. This paper addresses the problem of locating the source of a rumor in large social networks where some of these sensor nodes have failed. We estimate the missing information about the sensors using doubly non-negative (DN) matrix completion and compressed sensing techniques. This is then used to identify the actual source by using a maximum likelihood estimator we developed earlier, on a large data set from Sina Weibo. Results indicate that the estimation techniques result in almost as good a performance of the ML estimator as for the network for which complete information is available. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research work on source identification with incomplete information in social networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spy vs. Spy: Rumor Source Obfuscation](http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.8439v3)** | 2015-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anonymous messaging platforms, such as Secret and Whisper, have emerged as important social media for sharing one's thoughts without the fear of being judged by friends, family, or the public. Further, such anonymous platforms are crucial in nations with authoritarian governments; the right to free expression and sometimes the personal safety of the author of the message depend on anonymity. Whether for fear of judgment or personal endangerment, it is crucial to keep anonymous the identity of the user who initially posted a sensitive message. In this paper, we consider an adversary who observes a snapshot of the spread of a message at a certain time. Recent advances in rumor source detection shows that the existing messaging protocols are vulnerable against such an adversary. We introduce a novel messaging protocol, which we call adaptive diffusion, and show that it spreads the messages fast and achieves a perfect obfuscation of the source when the underlying contact network is an infinite regular tree: all users with the message are nearly equally likely to have been the origin of the message. Experiments on a sampled Facebook network show that it effectively hides the location of the source even when the graph is finite, irregular and has cycles. We further consider a stronger adversarial model where a subset of colluding users track the reception of messages. We show that the adaptive diffusion provides a strong protection of the anonymity of the source even under this scenario.</p></details> | 14 pages 10 figures |
| **[Rooting out the Rumor Culprit from Suspects](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.6312v4)** | 2013-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Suppose that a rumor originating from a single source among a set of suspects spreads in a network, how to root out this rumor source? With the a priori knowledge of suspect nodes and an observation of infected nodes, we construct a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator to identify the rumor source using the susceptible-infected (SI) model. The a priori suspect set and its associated connectivity bring about new ingredients to the problem, and thus we propose to use local rumor center, a generalized concept based on rumor centrality, to identify the source from suspects. For regular tree-type networks of node degree {\delta}, we characterize Pc(n), the correct detection probability of the estimator upon observing n infected nodes, in both the finite and asymptotic regimes. First, when every infected node is a suspect, Pc(n) asymptotically grows from 0.25 to 0.307 with {\delta} from 3 to infinity, a result first established in Shah and Zaman (2011, 2012) via a different approach; and it monotonically decreases with n and increases with {\delta}. Second, when the suspects form a connected subgraph of the network, Pc(n) asymptotically significantly exceeds the a priori probability if {\delta}>2, and reliable detection is achieved as {\delta} becomes large; furthermore, it monotonically decreases with n and increases with {\delta}. Third, when there are only two suspects, Pc(n) is asymptotically at least 0.75 if {\delta}>2; and it increases with the distance between the two suspects. Fourth, when there are multiple suspects, among all possible connection patterns, that they form a connected subgraph of the network achieves the smallest detection probability. Our analysis leverages ideas from the Polya's urn model in probability theory and sheds insight into the behavior of the rumor spreading process not only in the asymptotic regime but also for the general finite-n regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |
| **[Rumors in a Network: Who's the Culprit?](http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.4370v2)** | 2010-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a systematic study of the problem of finding the source of a rumor in a network. We model rumor spreading in a network with a variant of the popular SIR model and then construct an estimator for the rumor source. This estimator is based upon a novel topological quantity which we term \textbf{rumor centrality}. We establish that this is an ML estimator for a class of graphs. We find the following surprising threshold phenomenon: on trees which grow faster than a line, the estimator always has non-trivial detection probability, whereas on trees that grow like a line, the detection probability will go to 0 as the network grows. Simulations performed on synthetic networks such as the popular small-world and scale-free networks, and on real networks such as an internet AS network and the U.S. electric power grid network, show that the estimator either finds the source exactly or within a few hops of the true source across different network topologies. We compare rumor centrality to another common network centrality notion known as distance centrality. We prove that on trees, the rumor center and distance center are equivalent, but on general networks, they may differ. Indeed, simulations show that rumor centrality outperforms distance centrality in finding rumor sources in networks which are not tree-like.</p></details> | 43 pages, 13 figures |
