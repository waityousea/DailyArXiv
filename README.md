| **[HiFi-HARP: A High-Fidelity 7th-Order Ambisonic Room Impulse Response Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21257v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce HiFi-HARP, a large-scale dataset of 7th-order Higher-Order Ambisonic Room Impulse Responses (HOA-RIRs) consisting of more than 100,000 RIRs generated via a hybrid acoustic simulation in realistic indoor scenes. HiFi-HARP combines geometrically complex, furnished room models from the 3D-FRONT repository with a hybrid simulation pipeline: low-frequency wave-based simulation (finite-difference time-domain) up to 900 Hz is used, while high frequencies above 900 Hz are simulated using a ray-tracing approach. The combined raw RIRs are encoded into the spherical-harmonic domain (AmbiX ACN) for direct auralization. Our dataset extends prior work by providing 7th-order Ambisonic RIRs that combine wave-theoretic accuracy with realistic room content. We detail the generation pipeline (scene and material selection, array design, hybrid simulation, ambisonic encoding) and provide dataset statistics (room volumes, RT60 distributions, absorption properties). A comparison table highlights the novelty of HiFi-HARP relative to existing RIR collections. Finally, we outline potential benchmarks such as FOA-to-HOA upsampling, source localization, and dereverberation. We discuss machine learning use cases (spatial audio rendering, acoustic parameter estimation) and limitations (e.g., simulation approximations, static scenes). Overall, HiFi-HARP offers a rich resource for developing spatial audio and acoustics algorithms in complex environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[MRSAudio: A Large-Scale Multimodal Recorded Spatial Audio Dataset with Refined Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10396v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans rely on multisensory integration to perceive spatial environments, where auditory cues enable sound source localization in three-dimensional space. Despite the critical role of spatial audio in immersive technologies such as VR/AR, most existing multimodal datasets provide only monaural audio, which limits the development of spatial audio generation and understanding. To address these challenges, we introduce MRSAudio, a large-scale multimodal spatial audio dataset designed to advance research in spatial audio understanding and generation. MRSAudio spans four distinct components: MRSLife, MRSSpeech, MRSMusic, and MRSSing, covering diverse real-world scenarios. The dataset includes synchronized binaural and ambisonic audio, exocentric and egocentric video, motion trajectories, and fine-grained annotations such as transcripts, phoneme boundaries, lyrics, scores, and prompts. To demonstrate the utility and versatility of MRSAudio, we establish five foundational tasks: audio spatialization, and spatial text to speech, spatial singing voice synthesis, spatial music generation and sound event localization and detection. Results show that MRSAudio enables high-quality spatial modeling and supports a broad range of spatial audio research. Demos and dataset access are available at https://mrsaudio.github.io.</p></details> | 24 pages |
| **[Multi Agent Switching Mode Controller for Sound Source localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14849v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source seeking is an important topic in robotic research, especially considering sound-based sensors since they allow the agents to locate a target even in critical conditions where it is not possible to establish a direct line of sight. In this work, we design a multi- agent switching mode control strategy for acoustic-based target localization. Two scenarios are considered: single source localization, in which the agents are driven maintaining a rigid formation towards the target, and multi-source scenario, in which each agent searches for the targets independently from the others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Observer-Based Source Localization in Tree Infection Networks via Laplace Transforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09828v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of localizing the source of infection in an undirected, tree-structured network under a susceptible-infected outbreak model. The infection propagates with independent random time increments (i.e., edge-delays) between neighboring nodes, while only the infection times of a subset of nodes can be observed. We show that a reduced set of observers may be sufficient, in the statistical sense, to localize the source and characterize its identifiability via the joint Laplace transform of the observers' infection times. Using the explicit form of these transforms in terms of the edge-delay probability distributions, we propose scale-invariant least-squares estimators of the source. We evaluate their performance on synthetic trees and on a river network, demonstrating accurate localization under diverse edge-delay models. To conclude, we highlight overlooked technical challenges for observer-based source localization on networks with cycles, where standard spanning-tree reductions may be ill-posed.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 9 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Direction Estimation of Sound Sources Using Microphone Arrays and Signal Strength](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03466v3)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound-tracking refers to the process of determining the direction from which a sound originates, making it a fundamental component of sound source localization. This capability is essential in a variety of applications, including security systems, acoustic monitoring, and speaker tracking, where accurately identifying the direction of a sound source enables real-time responses, efficient resource allocation, and improved situational awareness. While sound-tracking is closely related to localization, it specifically focuses on identifying the direction of the sound source rather than estimating its exact position in space. Despite its utility, sound-tracking systems face several challenges, such as maintaining directional accuracy and precision, along with the need for sophisticated hardware configurations and complex signal processing algorithms. This paper presents a sound-tracking method using three electret microphones. We estimate the direction of a sound source using a lightweight method that analyzes signals from three strategically placed microphones. By comparing the average power of the received signals, the system infers the most probable direction of the sound. The results indicate that the power level from each microphone effectively determines the sound source direction. Our system employs a straightforward and cost-effective hardware design, ensuring simplicity and affordability in implementation. It achieves a localization error of less than 6 degrees and a precision of 98%. Additionally, its effortless integration with various systems makes it versatile and adaptable. Consequently, this technique presents a robust and reliable solution for sound-tracking and localization, with potential applications spanning diverse domains such as security systems, smart homes, and acoustic monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 32nd International Conference on Systems Engineering (ICSEng'2025)</p></details> |
| **[Estimating Brain Activity with High Spatial and Temporal Resolution using a Naturalistic MEG-fMRI Encoding Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09415v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current non-invasive neuroimaging techniques trade off between spatial resolution and temporal resolution. While magnetoencephalography (MEG) can capture rapid neural dynamics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) can spatially localize brain activity, a unified picture that preserves both high resolutions remains an unsolved challenge with existing source localization or MEG-fMRI fusion methods, especially for single-trial naturalistic data. We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wireless Datasets for Aerial Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08752v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into 5G-Advanced and future 6G networks presents a transformative opportunity for wireless connectivity, enabling agile deployment and improved LoS communications. However, the effective design and optimization of these aerial networks depend critically on high-quality, empirical data. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of publicly available wireless datasets collected from an airborne platform called Aerial Experimentation and Research Platform on Advanced Wireless (AERPAW). We highlight the unique challenges associated with generating reproducible aerial wireless datasets, and review the existing related works in the literature. Subsequently, for each dataset considered, we explain the hardware and software used, present the dataset format, provide representative results, and discuss how these datasets can be used to conduct additional research. The specific aerial wireless datasets presented include raw I/Q samples from a cellular network over different UAV trajectories, spectrum measurements at different altitudes, flying 4G base station (BS), a 5G-NSA Ericsson network, a LoRaWAN network, an radio frequency (RF) sensor network for source localization, wireless propagation data for various scenarios, and comparison of ray tracing and real-world propagation scenarios. References to all datasets and post-processing scripts are provided to enable full reproducibility of the results. Ultimately, we aim to guide the community toward effective dataset utilization for validating propagation models, developing machine learning algorithms, and advancing the next generation of aerial wireless systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geometric Autoencoder Priors for Bayesian Inversion: Learn First Observe Later](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19929v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering applications. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated and variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of the specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries. The method provides a flexible geometry-aware train-once-use-anywhere foundation model which is independent of any particular observation process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure-prior Informed Diffusion Model for Graph Source Localization with Limited Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17928v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source localization in graph information propagation is essential for mitigating network disruptions, including misinformation spread, cyber threats, and infrastructure failures. Existing deep generative approaches face significant challenges in real-world applications due to limited propagation data availability. We present SIDSL (\textbf{S}tructure-prior \textbf{I}nformed \textbf{D}iffusion model for \textbf{S}ource \textbf{L}ocalization), a generative diffusion framework that leverages topology-aware priors to enable robust source localization with limited data. SIDSL addresses three key challenges: unknown propagation patterns through structure-based source estimations via graph label propagation, complex topology-propagation relationships via a propagation-enhanced conditional denoiser with GNN-parameterized label propagation module, and class imbalance through structure-prior biased diffusion initialization. By learning pattern-invariant features from synthetic data generated by established propagation models, SIDSL enables effective knowledge transfer to real-world scenarios. Experimental evaluation on four real-world datasets demonstrates superior performance with 7.5-13.3\% F1 score improvements over baselines, including over 19\% improvement in few-shot and 40\% in zero-shot settings, validating the framework's effectiveness for practical source localization. Our code can be found \href{https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/SIDSL}{here}.</p></details> | CIKM 2025 |
| **[A Steered Response Power Method for Sound Source Localization With Generic Acoustic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15702v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The steered response power (SRP) method is one of the most popular approaches for acoustic source localization with microphone arrays. It is often based on simplifying acoustic assumptions, such as an omnidirectional sound source in the far field of the microphone array(s), free field propagation, and spatially uncorrelated noise. In reality, however, there are many acoustic scenarios where such assumptions are violated. This paper proposes a generalization of the conventional SRP method that allows to apply generic acoustic models for localization with arbitrary microphone constellations. These models may consider, for instance, level differences in distributed microphones, the directivity of sources and receivers, or acoustic shadowing effects. Moreover, also measured acoustic transfer functions may be applied as acoustic model. We show that the delay-and-sum beamforming of the conventional SRP is not optimal for localization with generic acoustic models. To this end, we propose a generalized SRP beamforming criterion that considers generic acoustic models and spatially correlated noise, and derive an optimal SRP beamformer. Furthermore, we propose and analyze appropriate frequency weightings. Unlike the conventional SRP, the proposed method can jointly exploit observed level and time differences between the microphone signals to infer the source location. Realistic simulations of three different microphone setups with speech under various noise conditions indicate that the proposed method can significantly reduce the mean localization error compared to the conventional SRP and, in particular, a reduction of more than 60% can be archived in noisy conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating the Limitations of Local LLMs in Solving Complex Programming Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15283v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines the performance of today's open-source, locally hosted large-language models (LLMs) in handling complex competitive programming tasks with extended problem descriptions and contexts. Building on the original Framework for AI-driven Code Generation Evaluation (FACE), the authors retrofit the pipeline to work entirely offline through the Ollama runtime, collapsing FACE's sprawling per-problem directory tree into a handful of consolidated JSON files, and adding robust checkpointing so multi-day runs can resume after failures. The enhanced framework generates, submits, and records solutions for the full Kattis corpus of 3,589 problems across eight code-oriented models ranging from 6.7-9 billion parameters. The submission results show that the overall pass@1 accuracy is modest for the local models, with the best models performing at approximately half the acceptance rate of the proprietary models, Gemini 1.5 and ChatGPT-4. These findings expose a persistent gap between private, cost-controlled LLM deployments and state-of-the-art proprietary services, yet also highlight the rapid progress of open models and the practical benefits of an evaluation workflow that organizations can replicate on in-house hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables, accepted to CCSC Eastern 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-robot Multi-source Localization in Complex Flows with Physics-Preserving Environment Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14228v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source localization in a complex flow poses a significant challenge for multi-robot teams tasked with localizing the source of chemical leaks or tracking the dispersion of an oil spill. The flow dynamics can be time-varying and chaotic, resulting in sporadic and intermittent sensor readings, and complex environmental geometries further complicate a team's ability to model and predict the dispersion. To accurately account for the physical processes that drive the dispersion dynamics, robots must have access to computationally intensive numerical models, which can be difficult when onboard computation is limited. We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source localization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element model of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are used to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an infotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to maximize informativeness for the source localization objective. Our approach achieves faster error reduction compared to baseline sensing strategies and results in more accurate source localization compared to baseline machine learning approaches.</p></details> |  |

| **[Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15315v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will commence full-scale operations in 2026, yielding an unprecedented volume of astronomical images. Constructing an astronomical catalog, a table of imaged stars, galaxies, and their properties, is a fundamental step in most scientific workflows based on astronomical image data. Traditional deterministic cataloging methods lack statistical coherence as cataloging is an ill-posed problem, while existing probabilistic approaches suffer from computational inefficiency, inaccuracy, or the inability to perform inference with multiband coadded images, the primary output format for LSST images. In this article, we explore a recently developed Bayesian inference method called neural posterior estimation (NPE) as an approach to cataloging. NPE leverages deep learning to achieve both computational efficiency and high accuracy. When evaluated on the DC2 Simulated Sky Survey -- a highly realistic synthetic dataset designed to mimic LSST data -- NPE systematically outperforms the standard LSST pipeline in light source detection, flux measurement, star/galaxy classification, and galaxy shape measurement. Additionally, NPE provides well-calibrated posterior approximations. These promising results, obtained using simulated data, illustrate the potential of NPE in the absence of model misspecification. Although some degree of model misspecification is inevitable in the application of NPE to real LSST images, there are a variety of strategies to mitigate its effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polarization based direction of arrival estimation using a radio interferometric array](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15116v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality images of the sky. Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary geometry and wide frequency variation) for DOA estimation is practically infeasible except by using images made by such interferometers. In this paper, we focus on low cost DOA estimation without imaging, using a subset of a radio interferometric array, using a fraction of the data collected by the full array, and, enabling early determination of DOAs. The proposed method is suitable for transient and low duty cycle source detection. Moreover, the proposed method is an ideal follow-up step to online radio frequency interference (RFI) mitigation, enabling the early estimation of the DOA of the detected RFI.</p></details> |  |

| **[Online Non-convex Optimization with Long-term Non-convex Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02426v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel Follow-the-Perturbed-Leader type algorithm is proposed and analyzed for solving general long-term constrained optimization problems in an online manner, where the target and constraint functions are oblivious adversarially generated and not necessarily convex. The algorithm is based on Lagrangian reformulation and innovatively integrates random perturbations and regularizations in primal and dual directions: 1). exponentially distributed random perturbations in the primal direction to handle non-convexity, and 2). strongly concave logarithmic regularizations in the dual space to handle constraint violations. Based on a proposed expected static cumulative regret, and under mild Lipschitz continuity assumption, the algorithm demonstrates the online learnability, achieving the first sublinear cumulative regret complexity for this class of problems. The proposed algorithm is applied to tackle a long-term (extreme value) constrained river pollutant source identification problem, validate the theoretical results and exhibit superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniDFA: A Unified Framework for Open Set Synthesis Image Detection and Few-Shot Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25682v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However, synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates $1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution. Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Physics-informed sensor coverage through structure preserving machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10363v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a machine learning framework for adaptive source localization in which agents use a structure-preserving digital twin of a coupled hydrodynamic-transport system for real-time trajectory planning and data assimilation. The twin is constructed with conditional neural Whitney forms (CNWF), coupling the numerical guarantees of finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) with transformer-based operator learning. The resulting model preserves discrete conservation, and adapts in real time to streaming sensor data. It employs a conditional attention mechanism to identify: a reduced Whitney-form basis; reduced integral balance equations; and a source field, each compatible with given sensor measurements. The induced reduced-order environmental model retains the stability and consistency of standard finite-element simulation, yielding a physically realizable, regular mapping from sensor data to the source field. We propose a staggered scheme that alternates between evaluating the digital twin and applying Lloyd's algorithm to guide sensor placement, with analysis providing conditions for monotone improvement of a coverage functional. Using the predicted source field as an importance function within an optimal-recovery scheme, we demonstrate recovery of point sources under continuity assumptions, highlighting the role of regularity as a sufficient condition for localization. Experimental comparisons with physics-agnostic transformer architectures show improved accuracy in complex geometries when physical constraints are enforced, indicating that structure preservation provides an effective inductive bias for source identification.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian thinning algorithm for the point source identification of heat equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14245v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a Bayesian thinning algorithm for recovering weighted point source functions in the heat equation from boundary flux observations. The major challenge in the classical Bayesian framework lies in constructing suitable priors for such highly structured unknowns. To address this, we introduce a level set representation on a discretized mesh for the unknown, which enables the infinite-dimensional Bayesian framework to the reconstruction. From another perspective, the point source configuration can be modeled as a marked Poisson point process (PPP), then a thinning mechanism is employed to selectively retain points. These two proposals are complementary with the Bayesian level set sampling generating candidate point sources and the thinning process acting as a filter to refine them. This combined framework is validated through numerical experiments, which demonstrate its accuracy in reconstructing point sources.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[An Unsupervised Deep XAI Framework for Localization of Concurrent Replay Attacks in Nuclear Reactor Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09162v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states. Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition, these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems, additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e., detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1 with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added references, corrected typos, grammar check, authors updated</p></details> |
| **[Set-Valued Transformer Network for High-Emission Mobile Source Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11976v1)** | 2025-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying high-emission vehicles is a crucial step in regulating urban pollution levels and formulating traffic emission reduction strategies. However, in practical monitoring data, the proportion of high-emission state data is significantly lower compared to normal emission states. This characteristic long-tailed distribution severely impedes the extraction of discriminative features for emission state identification during data mining. Furthermore, the highly nonlinear nature of vehicle emission states and the lack of relevant prior knowledge also pose significant challenges to the construction of identification models.To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Set-Valued Transformer Network (SVTN) to achieve comprehensive learning of discriminative features from high-emission samples, thereby enhancing detection accuracy. Specifically, this model first employs the transformer to measure the temporal similarity of micro-trip condition variations, thus constructing a mapping rule that projects the original high-dimensional emission data into a low-dimensional feature space. Next, a set-valued identification algorithm is used to probabilistically model the relationship between the generated feature vectors and their labels, providing an accurate metric criterion for the classification algorithm. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we conducted extensive experiments on the diesel vehicle monitoring data of Hefei city in 2020. The results demonstrate that our method achieves a 9.5\% reduction in the missed detection rate for high-emission vehicles compared to the transformer-based baseline, highlighting its superior capability in accurately identifying high-emission mobile pollution sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Horizontal and Vertical Federated Causal Structure Learning via Higher-order Cumulants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06888v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated causal discovery aims to uncover the causal relationships between entities while protecting data privacy, which has significant importance and numerous applications in real-world scenarios. Existing federated causal structure learning methods primarily focus on horizontal federated settings. However, in practical situations, different clients may not necessarily contain data on the same variables. In a single client, the incomplete set of variables can easily lead to spurious causal relationships, thereby affecting the information transmitted to other clients. To address this issue, we comprehensively consider causal structure learning methods under both horizontal and vertical federated settings. We provide the identification theories and methods for learning causal structure in the horizontal and vertical federal setting via higher-order cumulants. Specifically, we first aggregate higher-order cumulant information from all participating clients to construct global cumulant estimates. These global estimates are then used for recursive source identification, ultimately yielding a global causal strength matrix. Our approach not only enables the reconstruction of causal graphs but also facilitates the estimation of causal strength coefficients. Our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in experiments conducted on both synthetic data and real-world data.</p></details> |  |

The framework is applied to airborne contaminant tracking, extending recent dynamic sensor steering methods to complex geometries for computational efficiency. A C-optimal design criterion is employed to strategically place sensors, minimizing uncertainty in predictions.

| **[Moments, Time-Inversion and Source Identification for the Heat Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02677v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the initial source identification problem for the heat equation, a notably ill-posed inverse problem characterized by exponential instability. Departing from classical Tikhonov regularization, we propose a novel approach based on moment analysis of the heat flow, transforming the problem into a more stable inverse moment formulation. By evolving the measured terminal time moments backward through their governing ODE system, we recover the moments of the initial distribution. We then reconstruct the source by solving a convex optimization problem that minimizes the total variation of a measure subject to these moment constraints. This formulation naturally promotes sparsity, yielding atomic solutions that are sums of Dirac measures. Compared to existing methods, our moment-based approach reduces exponential error growth to polynomial growth with respect to the terminal time. We provide explicit error estimates on the recovered initial distributions in terms of moment order, terminal time, and measurement errors. In addition, we develop efficient numerical discretization schemes and demonstrate significant stability improvements of our approach through comprehensive numerical experiments.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Using Wavelet Domain Fingerprints to Improve Source Camera Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01712v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera fingerprint detection plays a crucial role in source identification and image forensics, with wavelet denoising approaches proving to be particularly effective in extracting sensor pattern noise (SPN). In this article, we propose a modification to wavelet-based SPN extraction. Rather than constructing the fingerprint as an image, we introduce the notion of a wavelet domain fingerprint. This avoids the final inversion step of the denoising algorithm and allows fingerprint comparisons to be made directly in the wavelet domain. As such, our modification streamlines the extraction and comparison process. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that our method not only achieves higher detection accuracy but can also significantly improve processing speed.</p></details> |  |

While a few demonstrations focused on the CMOS image sensors (CIS) and active pixel sensors (APS), single photon avalanche diode (SPAD) imagers have never been investigated for this purpose. In this work, we have proposed a novel watermarking technique using perimeter gated SPAD (pgSPAD) imagers. We utilized the DSNU of three 64 x 64 pgSPAD imager chips, fabricated in a 0.35 {\mu}m standard CMOS process and analyzed the simulated watermarks for standard test images from publicly available database. Our observation shows that both source identification and tamper detection can be achieved using the proposed source-scene-specific dynamic watermarks with a controllable sensitivity-robustness trade-off.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, accepted at MWSCAS 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[Multi-agent Systems for Misinformation Lifecycle : Detection, Correction And Source Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17511v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of misinformation in digital media demands solutions that go beyond isolated Large Language Model(LLM) or AI Agent based detection methods. This paper introduces a novel multi-agent framework that covers the complete misinformation lifecycle: classification, detection, correction, and source verification to deliver more transparent and reliable outcomes. In contrast to single-agent or monolithic architectures, our approach employs five specialized agents: an Indexer agent for dynamically maintaining trusted repositories, a Classifier agent for labeling misinformation types, an Extractor agent for evidence based retrieval and ranking, a Corrector agent for generating fact-based correction and a Verification agent for validating outputs and tracking source credibility. Each agent can be individually evaluated and optimized, ensuring scalability and adaptability as new types of misinformation and data sources emerge. By decomposing the misinformation lifecycle into specialized agents - our framework enhances scalability, modularity, and explainability. This paper proposes a high-level system overview, agent design with emphasis on transparency, evidence-based outputs, and source provenance to support robust misinformation detection and correction at scale.</p></details> |  |

While standards exist for sharing this information, much appears in non-standardized news articles or blogs. Monitoring online sources for threats is time-consuming and source selection is uncertain. Current research focuses on extracting Indicators of Compromise from known sources, rarely addressing new source identification. This paper proposes a CTI-focused crawler using multi-armed bandit (MAB) and various crawling strategies. It employs SBERT to identify relevant documents while dynamically adapting its crawling path. Our system ThreatCrawl achieves a harvest rate exceeding 25% and expands its seed by over 300% while maintaining topical focus. Additionally, the crawler identifies previously unknown but highly relevant overview pages, datasets, and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Multi-robot Source Seeking in Unknown Environments with Unknown Number of Sources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11048v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel distributed source seeking framework, DIAS, designed for multi-robot systems in scenarios where the number of sources is unknown and potentially exceeds the number of robots. Traditional robotic source seeking methods typically focused on directing each robot to a specific strong source and may fall short in comprehensively identifying all potential sources. DIAS addresses this gap by introducing a hybrid controller that identifies the presence of sources and then alternates between exploration for data gathering and exploitation for guiding robots to identified sources. It further enhances search efficiency by dividing the environment into Voronoi cells and approximating source density functions based on Gaussian process regression. Additionally, DIAS can be integrated with existing source seeking algorithms. We compare DIAS with existing algorithms, including DoSS and GMES in simulated gas leakage scenarios where the number of sources outnumbers or is equal to the number of robots. The numerical results show that DIAS outperforms the baseline methods in both the efficiency of source identification by the robots and the accuracy of the estimated environmental density function.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 |
| **[Real-time Pollutant Identification through Optical PM Micro-Sensor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10724v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Air pollution remains one of the most pressing environmental challenges of the modern era, significantly impacting human health, ecosystems, and climate. While traditional air quality monitoring systems provide critical data, their high costs and limited spatial coverage hinder effective real-time pollutant identification. Recent advancements in micro-sensor technology have improved data collection but still lack efficient methods for source identification. This paper explores the innovative application of machine learning (ML) models to classify pollutants in real-time using only data from optical micro-sensors. We propose a novel classification framework capable of distinguishing between four pollutant scenarios: Background Pollution, Ash, Sand, and Candle. Three Machine Learning (ML) approaches - XGBoost, Long Short-Term Memory networks, and Hidden Markov Chains - are evaluated for their effectiveness in sequence modeling and pollutant identification. Our results demonstrate the potential of leveraging micro-sensors and ML techniques to enhance air quality monitoring, offering actionable insights for urban planning and environmental protection.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Detecting such images and identifying their source models has become a critical challenge in ensuring the integrity of digital media. This paper tackles the detection of AI-generated images and identifying their source models using CNN and CLIP-ViT classifiers. For the CNN-based classifier, we leverage EfficientNet-B0 as the backbone and feed with RGB channels, frequency features, and reconstruction errors, while for CLIP-ViT, we adopt a pretrained CLIP image encoder to extract image features and SVM to perform classification. Evaluated on the Defactify 4 dataset, our methods demonstrate strong performance in both tasks, with CLIP-ViT showing superior robustness to image perturbations. Compared to baselines like AEROBLADE and OCC-CLIP, our approach achieves competitive results. Notably, our method ranked Top-3 overall in the Defactify 4 competition, highlighting its effectiveness and generalizability. All of our implementations can be found in https://github.com/uuugaga/Defactify_4</p></details> |  |
| **[Rapid Parameter Inference with Uncertainty Quantification for a Radiological Plume Source Identification Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17492v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the event of a nuclear accident, or the detonation of a radiological dispersal device, quickly locating the source of the accident or blast is important for emergency response and environmental decontamination. At a specified time after a simulated instantaneous release of an aerosolized radioactive contaminant, measurements are recorded downwind from an array of radiation sensors. Neural networks are employed to infer the source release parameters in an accurate and rapid manner using sensor and mean wind speed data. We consider two neural network constructions that quantify the uncertainty of the predicted values; a categorical classification neural network and a Bayesian neural network. With the categorical classification neural network, we partition the spatial domain and treat each partition as a separate class for which we estimate the probability that it contains the true source location. In a Bayesian neural network, the weights and biases have a distribution rather than a single optimal value. With each evaluation, these distributions are sampled, yielding a different prediction with each evaluation. The trained Bayesian neural network is thus evaluated to construct posterior densities for the release parameters. Results are compared to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) results found using the Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis Algorithm. The Bayesian neural network approach is generally much cheaper computationally than the MCMC approach as it relies on the computational cost of the neural network evaluation to generate posterior densities as opposed to the MCMC approach which depends on the computational expense of the transport and radiation detection models.</p></details> |  |

Despite their therapeutic importance, these products can aggregate and form subvisible particles (SvPs), which can compromise their efficacy and trigger immunological responses, emphasizing the critical need for robust monitoring techniques. Flow Imaging Microscopy (FIM) has been a significant advancement in detecting SvPs, evolving from monochrome to more recently incorporating color imaging. Complementing SvP images obtained via FIM, deep learning techniques have recently been employed successfully for stress source identification of monochrome SvPs. In this study, we explore the potential of color FIM to enhance the characterization of stress sources in SvPs. To achieve this, we curate a new dataset comprising 16,000 SvPs from eight commercial monoclonal antibodies subjected to heat and mechanical stress. Using both supervised and self-supervised convolutional neural networks, as well as vision transformers in large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that deep learning with color FIM images consistently outperforms monochrome images, thus highlighting the potential of color FIM in stress source classification compared to its monochrome counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in MICCAI 2024 Workshop on Medical Optical Imaging and Virtual Microscopy Image Analysis (MOVI)</p></details> |

We establish the well-posedness of the direct problem in the sense of transposition and improved local regularity. Using classical unique continuation of the subdiffusion model and improved local solution regularity, we prove the uniqueness of simultaneously recovering the locations of point sources, time-dependent strengths and initial condition for both one- and multi-dimensional cases. Moreover, in the one-dimensional case, the elliptic operator can have time-dependent coefficients. These results extend existing studies on point source identification for parabolic type problems. Additionally we present several numerical experiments to show the feasibility of numerical reconstruction.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

Diffusive capture problems are computationally challenging due to the complex geometry and the applied boundary conditions together with intrinsically long transients that occur before a particle is captured. This paper reports on a particle-based Kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method that provides rapid accurate simulation of arrival statistics for (i) a half-space bounded by a surface with a finite collection of absorbing traps and (ii) the domain exterior to a convex cell again with absorbing traps. We validate our method by replicating classical results and in addition, newly developed boundary homogenization theories and matched asymptotic expansions on capture rates. In the case of non-spherical domains, we describe a new shielding effect in which geometry can play a role in sharpening cellular estimates on the directionality of diffusive sources.</p></details> | 32 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Radio U-Net: a convolutional neural network to detect diffuse radio sources in galaxy clusters and beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10871v1)** | 2024-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forthcoming generation of radio telescope arrays promises significant advancements in sensitivity and resolution, enabling the identification and characterization of many new faint and diffuse radio sources. Conventional manual cataloging methodologies are anticipated to be insufficient to exploit the capabilities of new radio surveys. Radio interferometric images of diffuse sources present a challenge for image segmentation tasks due to noise, artifacts, and embedded radio sources. In response to these challenges, we introduce Radio U-Net, a fully convolutional neural network based on the U-Net architecture. Radio U-Net is designed to detect faint and extended sources in radio surveys, such as radio halos, relics, and cosmic web filaments. Radio U-Net was trained on synthetic radio observations built upon cosmological simulations and then tested on a sample of galaxy clusters, where the detection of cluster diffuse radio sources relied on customized data reduction and visual inspection of LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) data. The 83% of clusters exhibiting diffuse radio emission were accurately identified, and the segmentation successfully recovered the morphology of the sources even in low-quality images. In a test sample comprising 246 galaxy clusters, we achieved a 73% accuracy rate in distinguishing between clusters with and without diffuse radio emission. Our results establish the applicability of Radio U-Net to extensive radio survey datasets, probing its efficiency on cutting-edge high-performance computing systems. This approach represents an advancement in optimizing the exploitation of forthcoming large radio surveys for scientific exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MNRAS, 16 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Source Localization for Cross Network Information Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14668v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source localization aims to locate information diffusion sources only given the diffusion observation, which has attracted extensive attention in the past few years. Existing methods are mostly tailored for single networks and may not be generalized to handle more complex networks like cross-networks. Cross-network is defined as two interconnected networks, where one network's functionality depends on the other. Source localization on cross-networks entails locating diffusion sources on the source network by only giving the diffused observation in the target network. The task is challenging due to challenges including: 1) diffusion sources distribution modeling; 2) jointly considering both static and dynamic node features; and 3) heterogeneous diffusion patterns learning. In this work, we propose a novel method, namely CNSL, to handle the three primary challenges. Specifically, we propose to learn the distribution of diffusion sources through Bayesian inference and leverage disentangled encoders to separately learn static and dynamic node features. The learning objective is coupled with the cross-network information propagation estimation model to make the inference of diffusion sources considering the overall diffusion process. Additionally, we also provide two novel cross-network datasets collected by ourselves. Extensive experiments are conducted on both datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of \textit{CNSL} in handling the source localization on cross-networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data are available at: https://github.com/tanmoysr/CNSL/</p></details> |

Recent advances of cross-modal foundation models (e.g., CLIP) have made this problem feasible. Those approaches commonly leverage CLIP to align the holistic semantics of stylized mesh with the given text prompt. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to enable more controllable stylization of fine-grained details in 3D meshes solely based on such semantic-level cross-modal supervision. In this work, we propose a new 3DStyle-Diffusion model that triggers fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes with additional controllable appearance and geometric guidance from 2D Diffusion models. Technically, 3DStyle-Diffusion first parameterizes the texture of 3D mesh into reflectance properties and scene lighting using implicit MLP networks. Meanwhile, an accurate depth map of each sampled view is achieved conditioned on 3D mesh. Then, 3DStyle-Diffusion leverages a pre-trained controllable 2D Diffusion model to guide the learning of rendered images, encouraging the synthesized image of each view semantically aligned with text prompt and geometrically consistent with depth map. This way elegantly integrates both image rendering via implicit MLP networks and diffusion process of image synthesis in an end-to-end fashion, enabling a high-quality fine-grained stylization of 3D meshes. We also build a new dataset derived from Objaverse and the evaluation protocol for this task. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we validate the capability of our 3DStyle-Diffusion.

Existing approaches in rumor source detection predominantly focus on dyadic interactions, which inadequately address the complexity of more intricate relational structures. In this study, we present a novel approach for Source Detection in Hypergraphs (HyperDet) via Interactive Relationship Construction and Feature-rich Attention Fusion. Specifically, our methodology employs an Interactive Relationship Construction module to accurately model both the static topology and dynamic interactions among users, followed by the Feature-rich Attention Fusion module, which autonomously learns node features and discriminates between nodes using a self-attention mechanism, thereby effectively learning node representations under the framework of accurately modeled higher-order relationships. Extensive experimental validation confirms the efficacy of our HyperDet approach, showcasing its superiority relative to current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI25 |
| **[Detection of Rumors and Their Sources in Social Networks: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05292v1)** | 2025-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent advancements in social network platform technology, an overwhelming amount of information is spreading rapidly. In this situation, it can become increasingly difficult to discern what information is false or true. If false information proliferates significantly, it can lead to undesirable outcomes. Hence, when we receive some information, we can pose the following two questions: $(i)$ Is the information true? $(ii)$ If not, who initially spread that information? % The first problem is the rumor detection issue, while the second is the rumor source detection problem. A rumor-detection problem involves identifying and mitigating false or misleading information spread via various communication channels, particularly online platforms and social media. Rumors can range from harmless ones to deliberately misleading content aimed at deceiving or manipulating audiences. Detecting misinformation is crucial for maintaining the integrity of information ecosystems and preventing harmful effects such as the spread of false beliefs, polarization, and even societal harm. Therefore, it is very important to quickly distinguish such misinformation while simultaneously finding its source to block it from spreading on the network. However, most of the existing surveys have analyzed these two issues separately. In this work, we first survey the existing research on the rumor-detection and rumor source detection problems with joint detection approaches, simultaneously. % This survey deals with these two issues together so that their relationship can be observed and it provides how the two problems are similar and different. The limitations arising from the rumor detection, rumor source detection, and their combination problems are also explained, and some challenges to be addressed in future works are presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Examining the Limitations of Computational Rumor Detection Models Trained on Static Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11576v2)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A crucial aspect of a rumor detection model is its ability to generalize, particularly its ability to detect emerging, previously unknown rumors. Past research has indicated that content-based (i.e., using solely source posts as input) rumor detection models tend to perform less effectively on unseen rumors. At the same time, the potential of context-based models remains largely untapped. The main contribution of this paper is in the in-depth evaluation of the performance gap between content and context-based models specifically on detecting new, unseen rumors. Our empirical findings demonstrate that context-based models are still overly dependent on the information derived from the rumors' source post and tend to overlook the significant role that contextual information can play. We also study the effect of data split strategies on classifier performance. Based on our experimental results, the paper also offers practical suggestions on how to minimize the effects of temporal concept drift in static datasets during the training of rumor detection methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

Although recent solutions have enhanced performance by leveraging deep neural networks, they often require complete user data. In this paper, we address a more challenging task, rumor source detection with incomplete user data, and propose a novel framework, i.e., Source Detection in Graphs with Incomplete Nodes via Positional Encoding and Attentive Fusion (GIN-SD), to tackle this challenge. Specifically, our approach utilizes a positional embedding module to distinguish nodes that are incomplete and employs a self-attention mechanism to focus on nodes with greater information transmission capacity. To mitigate the prediction bias caused by the significant disparity between the numbers of source and non-source nodes, we also introduce a class-balancing mechanism. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of GIN-SD and its superiority to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is accepted by AAAI24</p></details> |

In this model, a small subset of nodes from a network are the source of a rumor. In discrete time steps, each informed node "infects" each of its uninformed neighbors with probability $p$. While many facets of this process are studied in the literature, less is known about the inference problem: given a number of infected nodes in a network, can we learn the source of the rumor? In the context of epidemiology this problem is often referred to as patient zero problem. It belongs to a broader class of problems where the goal is to infer parameters of the underlying spreading model, see, e.g., Lokhov [NeurIPS'16] or Mastakouri et al. [NeurIPS'20]. In this work we present a maximum likelihood estimator for the rumor's source, given a snapshot of the process in terms of a set of active nodes $X$ after $t$ steps. Our results show that, for cycle-free graphs, the likelihood estimator undergoes a non-trivial phase transition as a function $t$. We provide a rigorous analysis for two prominent classes of acyclic network, namely $d$-regular trees and Galton-Watson trees, and verify empirically that our heuristics work well in various general networks.</p></details> |  |
